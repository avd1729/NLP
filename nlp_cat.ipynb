      "[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ] VOLUME I CHAPTER \n",
      "I Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich \n",
      ", with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed \n",
      "to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; \n",
      "and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with \n",
      "very little to distress or vex her . She was \n",
      "the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate \n",
      ", indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of \n",
      "her sister 's marriage , been mistress of his house \n",
      "from a very early period . Her mother had died \n",
      "too long ago for her to have more than an \n",
      "indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had \n",
      "been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who \n",
      "had fallen little short of a mother in affection . \n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse 's \n",
      "family , less as a governess than a friend , \n",
      "very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma \n",
      ". Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters \n",
      ". Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the \n",
      "nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper \n",
      "had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and \n",
      "the shadow of authority being now long passed away , \n",
      "they had been living together as friend and friend very \n",
      "mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked \n",
      "; highly esteeming Miss Taylor 's judgment , but directed \n",
      "chiefly by her own . The real evils , indeed \n",
      ", of Emma 's situation were the power of having \n",
      "rather too much her own way , and a disposition \n",
      "to think a little too well of herself ; these \n",
      "were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments \n",
      ". The danger , however , was at present so \n",
      "unperceived , that they did not by any means rank \n",
      "as misfortunes with her . Sorrow came -- a gentle \n",
      "sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of \n",
      "any disagreeable consciousness. -- Miss Taylor married . It was \n",
      "Miss Taylor 's loss which first brought grief . It \n",
      "was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma \n",
      "first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . The \n",
      "wedding over , and the bride-people gone , her father \n",
      "and herself were left to dine together , with no \n",
      "prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . \n",
      "Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as \n",
      "usual , and she had then only to sit and \n",
      "think of what she had lost . The event had \n",
      "every promise of happiness for her friend . Mr. Weston \n",
      "was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , \n",
      "suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was \n",
      "some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying , generous friendship \n",
      "she had always wished and promoted the match ; but \n",
      "it was a black morning 's work for her . \n",
      "The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour \n",
      "of every day . She recalled her past kindness -- \n",
      "the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how \n",
      "she had taught and how she had played with her \n",
      "from five years old -- how she had devoted all \n",
      "her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- \n",
      "and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood \n",
      ". A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; \n",
      "but the intercourse of the last seven years , the \n",
      "equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella \n",
      "'s marriage , on their being left to each other \n",
      ", was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She \n",
      "had been a friend and companion such as few possessed \n",
      ": intelligent , well-informed , useful , gentle , knowing \n",
      "all the ways of the family , interested in all \n",
      "its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in \n",
      "every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to \n",
      "whom she could speak every thought as it arose , \n",
      "and who had such an affection for her as could \n",
      "never find fault . How was she to bear the \n",
      "change ? -- It was true that her friend was \n",
      "going only half a mile from them ; but Emma \n",
      "was aware that great must be the difference between a \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , only half a mile from them , \n",
      "and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with \n",
      "all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was \n",
      "now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . \n",
      "She dearly loved her father , but he was no \n",
      "companion for her . He could not meet her in \n",
      "conversation , rational or playful . The evil of the \n",
      "actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr. Woodhouse had \n",
      "not married early ) was much increased by his constitution \n",
      "and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his \n",
      "life , without activity of mind or body , he \n",
      "was a much older man in ways than in years \n",
      "; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his \n",
      "heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not \n",
      "have recommended him at any time . Her sister , \n",
      "though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled \n",
      "in London , only sixteen miles off , was much \n",
      "beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October \n",
      "and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , \n",
      "before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her \n",
      "husband , and their little children , to fill the \n",
      "house , and give her pleasant society again . Highbury \n",
      ", the large and populous village , almost amounting to \n",
      "a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of \n",
      "its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , \n",
      "did really belong , afforded her no equals . The \n",
      "Woodhouses were first in consequence there . All looked up \n",
      "to them . She had many acquaintance in the place \n",
      ", for her father was universally civil , but not \n",
      "one among them who could be accepted in lieu of \n",
      "Miss Taylor for even half a day . It was \n",
      "a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh \n",
      "over it , and wish for impossible things , till \n",
      "her father awoke , and made it necessary to be \n",
      "cheerful . His spirits required support . He was a \n",
      "nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body \n",
      "that he was used to , and hating to part \n",
      "with them ; hating change of every kind . Matrimony \n",
      ", as the origin of change , was always disagreeable \n",
      "; and he was by no means yet reconciled to \n",
      "his own daughter 's marrying , nor could ever speak \n",
      "of her but with compassion , though it had been \n",
      "entirely a match of affection , when he was now \n",
      "obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from \n",
      "his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never \n",
      "able to suppose that other people could feel differently from \n",
      "himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss \n",
      "Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as \n",
      "for them , and would have been a great deal \n",
      "happier if she had spent all the rest of her \n",
      "life at Hartfield . Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully \n",
      "as she could , to keep him from such thoughts \n",
      "; but when tea came , it was impossible for \n",
      "him not to say exactly as he had said at \n",
      "dinner , '' Poor Miss Taylor ! -- I wish \n",
      "she were here again . What a pity it is \n",
      "that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! '' `` \n",
      "I can not agree with you , papa ; you \n",
      "know I can not . Mr. Weston is such a \n",
      "good-humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly \n",
      "deserves a good wife ; -- and you would not \n",
      "have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , \n",
      "and bear all my odd humours , when she might \n",
      "have a house of her own ? '' `` A \n",
      "house of her own ! -- But where is the \n",
      "advantage of a house of her own ? This is \n",
      "three times as large. -- And you have never any \n",
      "odd humours , my dear . '' `` How often \n",
      "we shall be going to see them , and they \n",
      "coming to see us ! -- We shall be always \n",
      "meeting ! _We_ must begin ; we must go and \n",
      "pay wedding visit very soon . '' `` My dear \n",
      ", how am I to get so far ? Randalls \n",
      "is such a distance . I could not walk half \n",
      "so far . '' `` No , papa , nobody \n",
      "thought of your walking . We must go in the \n",
      "carriage , to be sure . '' `` The carriage \n",
      "! But James will not like to put the horses \n",
      "to for such a little way ; -- and where \n",
      "are the poor horses to be while we are paying \n",
      "our visit ? '' `` They are to be put \n",
      "into Mr. Weston 's stable , papa . You know \n",
      "we have settled all that already . We talked it \n",
      "all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as \n",
      "for James , you may be very sure he will \n",
      "always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter \n",
      "'s being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he \n",
      "will ever take us anywhere else . That was your \n",
      "doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place \n",
      ". Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- \n",
      "James is so obliged to you ! '' `` I \n",
      "am very glad I did think of her . It \n",
      "was very lucky , for I would not have had \n",
      "poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and \n",
      "I am sure she will make a very good servant \n",
      ": she is a civil , pretty-spoken girl ; I \n",
      "have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see \n",
      "her , she always curtseys and asks me how I \n",
      "do , in a very pretty manner ; and when \n",
      "you have had her here to do needlework , I \n",
      "observe she always turns the lock of the door the \n",
      "right way and never bangs it . I am sure \n",
      "she will be an excellent servant ; and it will \n",
      "be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have \n",
      "somebody about her that she is used to see . \n",
      "Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you \n",
      "know , she will be hearing of us . He \n",
      "will be able to tell her how we all are \n",
      ". '' Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier \n",
      "flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help \n",
      "of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the \n",
      "evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her \n",
      "own . The backgammon-table was placed ; but a visitor \n",
      "immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary . Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty , \n",
      "was not only a very old and intimate friend of \n",
      "the family , but particularly connected with it , as \n",
      "the elder brother of Isabella 's husband . He lived \n",
      "about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor \n",
      ", and always welcome , and at this time more \n",
      "welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual \n",
      "connexions in London . He had returned to a late \n",
      "dinner , after some days ' absence , and now \n",
      "walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well \n",
      "in Brunswick Square . It was a happy circumstance , \n",
      "and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time . Mr. Knightley \n",
      "had a cheerful manner , which always did him good \n",
      "; and his many inquiries after `` poor Isabella '' \n",
      "and her children were answered most satisfactorily . When this \n",
      "was over , Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed , `` It \n",
      "is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to \n",
      "come out at this late hour to call upon us \n",
      ". I am afraid you must have had a shocking \n",
      "walk . '' `` Not at all , sir . \n",
      "It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild \n",
      "that I must draw back from your great fire . \n",
      "'' `` But you must have found it very damp \n",
      "and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold \n",
      ". '' `` Dirty , sir ! Look at my \n",
      "shoes . Not a speck on them . '' `` \n",
      "Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have \n",
      "had a vast deal of rain here . It rained \n",
      "dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at \n",
      "breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding \n",
      ". '' `` By the bye -- I have not \n",
      "wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what \n",
      "sort of joy you must both be feeling , I \n",
      "have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but \n",
      "I hope it all went off tolerably well . How \n",
      "did you all behave ? Who cried most ? '' \n",
      "`` Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! 'T is a \n",
      "sad business . '' `` Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse \n",
      ", if you please ; but I can not possibly \n",
      "say ` poor Miss Taylor . ' I have a \n",
      "great regard for you and Emma ; but when it \n",
      "comes to the question of dependence or independence ! -- \n",
      "At any rate , it must be better to have \n",
      "only one to please than two . '' `` Especially \n",
      "when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , \n",
      "troublesome creature ! '' said Emma playfully . `` That \n",
      "is what you have in your head , I know \n",
      "-- and what you would certainly say if my father \n",
      "were not by . '' `` I believe it is \n",
      "very true , my dear , indeed , '' said \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse , with a sigh . `` I am \n",
      "afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . '' \n",
      "`` My dearest papa ! You do not think I \n",
      "could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean \n",
      "_you_ . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! \n",
      "I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find \n",
      "fault with me , you know -- in a joke \n",
      "-- it is all a joke . We always say \n",
      "what we like to one another . '' Mr. Knightley \n",
      ", in fact , was one of the few people \n",
      "who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the \n",
      "only one who ever told her of them : and \n",
      "though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , \n",
      "she knew it would be so much less so to \n",
      "her father , that she would not have him really \n",
      "suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect \n",
      "by every body . `` Emma knows I never flatter \n",
      "her , '' said Mr. Knightley , `` but I \n",
      "meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has \n",
      "been used to have two persons to please ; she \n",
      "will now have but one . The chances are that \n",
      "she must be a gainer . '' `` Well , \n",
      "'' said Emma , willing to let it pass -- \n",
      "'' you want to hear about the wedding ; and \n",
      "I shall be happy to tell you , for we \n",
      "all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every \n",
      "body in their best looks : not a tear , \n",
      "and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh \n",
      "no ; we all felt that we were going to \n",
      "be only half a mile apart , and were sure \n",
      "of meeting every day . '' `` Dear Emma bears \n",
      "every thing so well , '' said her father . \n",
      "`` But , Mr. Knightley , she is really very \n",
      "sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am \n",
      "sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for \n",
      ". '' Emma turned away her head , divided between \n",
      "tears and smiles . `` It is impossible that Emma \n",
      "should not miss such a companion , '' said Mr. \n",
      "Knightley . `` We should not like her so well \n",
      "as we do , sir , if we could suppose \n",
      "it ; but she knows how much the marriage is \n",
      "to Miss Taylor 's advantage ; she knows how very \n",
      "acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor 's time \n",
      "of life , to be settled in a home of \n",
      "her own , and how important to her to be \n",
      "secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not \n",
      "allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . \n",
      "Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have \n",
      "her so happily married . '' `` And you have \n",
      "forgotten one matter of joy to me , '' said \n",
      "Emma , '' and a very considerable one -- that \n",
      "I made the match myself . I made the match \n",
      ", you know , four years ago ; and to \n",
      "have it take place , and be proved in the \n",
      "right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would \n",
      "never marry again , may comfort me for any thing \n",
      ". '' Mr. Knightley shook his head at her . \n",
      "Her father fondly replied , '' Ah ! my dear \n",
      ", I wish you would not make matches and foretell \n",
      "things , for whatever you say always comes to pass \n",
      ". Pray do not make any more matches . '' \n",
      "`` I promise you to make none for myself , \n",
      "papa ; but I must , indeed , for other \n",
      "people . It is the greatest amusement in the world \n",
      "! And after such success , you know ! -- \n",
      "Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again \n",
      ". Oh dear , no ! Mr. Weston , who \n",
      "had been a widower so long , and who seemed \n",
      "so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied \n",
      "either in his business in town or among his friends \n",
      "here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful \n",
      "-- Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in \n",
      "the year alone if he did not like it . \n",
      "Oh no ! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again \n",
      ". Some people even talked of a promise to his \n",
      "wife on her deathbed , and others of the son \n",
      "and the uncle not letting him . All manner of \n",
      "solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I \n",
      "believed none of it . `` Ever since the day \n",
      "-- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and \n",
      "I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , \n",
      "because it began to drizzle , he darted away with \n",
      "so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us \n",
      "from Farmer Mitchell 's , I made up my mind \n",
      "on the subject . I planned the match from that \n",
      "hour ; and when such success has blessed me in \n",
      "this instance , dear papa , you can not think \n",
      "that I shall leave off match-making . '' `` I \n",
      "do not understand what you mean by ` success , \n",
      "' '' said Mr. Knightley . `` Success supposes endeavour \n",
      ". Your time has been properly and delicately spent , \n",
      "if you have been endeavouring for the last four years \n",
      "to bring about this marriage . A worthy employment for \n",
      "a young lady 's mind ! But if , which \n",
      "I rather imagine , your making the match , as \n",
      "you call it , means only your planning it , \n",
      "your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I \n",
      "think it would be a very good thing for Miss \n",
      "Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her , ' \n",
      "and saying it again to yourself every now and then \n",
      "afterwards , why do you talk of success ? Where \n",
      "is your merit ? What are you proud of ? \n",
      "You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all \n",
      "that can be said . '' `` And have you \n",
      "never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess \n",
      "? -- I pity you. -- I thought you cleverer \n",
      "-- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is \n",
      "never merely luck . There is always some talent in \n",
      "it . And as to my poor word ` success \n",
      ", ' which you quarrel with , I do not \n",
      "know that I am so entirely without any claim to \n",
      "it . You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but \n",
      "I think there may be a third -- a something \n",
      "between the do-nothing and the do-all . If I had \n",
      "not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here , and given many \n",
      "little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it \n",
      "might not have come to any thing after all . \n",
      "I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that \n",

      "him to chuse his own wife . Depend upon it \n",
      ", a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care \n",
      "of himself . '' CHAPTER II Mr. Weston was a \n",
      "native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family \n",
      ", which for the last two or three generations had \n",
      "been rising into gentility and property . He had received \n",
      "a good education , but , on succeeding early in \n",
      "life to a small independence , had become indisposed for \n",
      "any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers \n",
      "were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful \n",
      "mind and social temper by entering into the militia of \n",
      "his county , then embodied . Captain Weston was a \n",
      "general favourite ; and when the chances of his military \n",
      "life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a \n",
      "great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love \n",
      "with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother \n",
      "and his wife , who had never seen him , \n",
      "and who were full of pride and importance , which \n",
      "the connexion would offend . Miss Churchill , however , \n",
      "being of age , and with the full command of \n",
      "her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to \n",
      "the family-estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the \n",
      "marriage , and it took place , to the infinite \n",
      "mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , who threw her \n",
      "off with due decorum . It was an unsuitable connexion \n",
      ", and did not produce much happiness . Mrs. Weston \n",
      "ought to have found more in it , for she \n",
      "had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made \n",
      "him think every thing due to her in return for \n",
      "the great goodness of being in love with him ; \n",
      "but though she had one sort of spirit , she \n",
      "had not the best . She had resolution enough to \n",
      "pursue her own will in spite of her brother , \n",
      "but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that \n",
      "brother 's unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries \n",
      "of her former home . They lived beyond their income \n",
      ", but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe \n",
      ": she did not cease to love her husband , \n",
      "but she wanted at once to be the wife of \n",
      "Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe . Captain \n",
      "Weston , who had been considered , especially by the \n",
      "Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was \n",
      "proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; \n",
      "for when his wife died , after a three years \n",
      "' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than \n",
      "at first , and with a child to maintain . \n",
      "From the expense of the child , however , he \n",
      "was soon relieved . The boy had , with the \n",
      "additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother \n",
      "'s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation \n",
      "; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , having no children \n",
      "of their own , nor any other young creature of \n",
      "equal kindred to care for , offered to take the \n",
      "whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease \n",
      ". Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be \n",
      "supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome \n",
      "by other considerations , the child was given up to \n",
      "the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and \n",
      "he had only his own comfort to seek , and \n",
      "his own situation to improve as he could . A \n",
      "complete change of life became desirable . He quitted the \n",
      "militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established \n",
      "in a good way in London , which afforded him \n",
      "a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought \n",
      "just employment enough . He had still a small house \n",
      "in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were \n",
      "spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of \n",
      "society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his \n",
      "life passed cheerfully away . He had , by that \n",
      "time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure \n",
      "the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which \n",
      "he had always longed for -- enough to marry a \n",
      "woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to \n",
      "live according to the wishes of his own friendly and \n",
      "social disposition . It was now some time since Miss \n",
      "Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as \n",
      "it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth \n",
      ", it had not shaken his determination of never settling \n",
      "till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of \n",
      "Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had \n",
      "gone steadily on , with these objects in view , \n",
      "till they were accomplished . He had made his fortune \n",
      ", bought his house , and obtained his wife ; \n",
      "and was beginning a new period of existence , with \n",
      "every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed \n",
      "through . He had never been an unhappy man ; \n",
      "his own temper had secured him from that , even \n",
      "in his first marriage ; but his second must shew \n",
      "him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could \n",
      "be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of \n",
      "its being a great deal better to choose than to \n",
      "be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it \n",
      ". He had only himself to please in his choice \n",
      ": his fortune was his own ; for as to \n",
      "Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up \n",
      "as his uncle 's heir , it had become so \n",
      "avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name \n",
      "of Churchill on coming of age . It was most \n",
      "unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his \n",
      "father 's assistance . His father had no apprehension of \n",
      "it . The aunt was a capricious woman , and \n",
      "governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in \n",
      "Mr. Weston 's nature to imagine that any caprice could \n",
      "be strong enough to affect one so dear , and \n",
      ", as he believed , so deservedly dear . He \n",
      "saw his son every year in London , and was \n",
      "proud of him ; and his fond report of him \n",
      "as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel \n",
      "a sort of pride in him too . He was \n",
      "looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make \n",
      "his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . \n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury \n",
      ", and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , \n",
      "though the compliment was so little returned that he had \n",
      "never been there in his life . His coming to \n",
      "visit his father had been often talked of but never \n",
      "achieved . Now , upon his father 's marriage , \n",
      "it was very generally proposed , as a most proper \n",
      "attention , that the visit should take place . There \n",
      "was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either \n",
      "when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates \n",
      ", or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit \n",
      ". Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to \n",
      "come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it \n",
      "was understood that he had written to his new mother \n",
      "on the occasion . For a few days , every \n",
      "morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome \n",
      "letter Mrs. Weston had received . `` I suppose you \n",
      "have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has \n",
      "written to Mrs. Weston ? I understand it was a \n",
      "very handsome letter , indeed . Mr. Woodhouse told me \n",
      "of it . Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter , and \n",
      "he says he never saw such a handsome letter in \n",
      "his life . '' It was , indeed , a \n",
      "highly prized letter . Mrs. Weston had , of course \n",
      ", formed a very favourable idea of the young man \n",
      "; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof \n",
      "of his great good sense , and a most welcome \n",
      "addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which \n",
      "her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a \n",
      "most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough \n",
      "to know how fortunate she might well be thought , \n",
      "where the only regret was for a partial separation from \n",
      "friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and \n",
      "who could ill bear to part with her . She \n",
      "knew that at times she must be missed ; and \n",
      "could not think , without pain , of Emma 's \n",
      "losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's \n",
      "ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but \n",
      "dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was \n",
      "more equal to her situation than most girls would have \n",
      "been , and had sense , and energy , and \n",
      "spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and \n",
      "happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then \n",
      "there was such comfort in the very easy distance of \n",
      "Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female \n",
      "walking , and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances , \n",
      "which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their \n",
      "spending half the evenings in the week together . Her \n",
      "situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; \n",
      "and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her \n",
      "cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , \n",
      "that Emma , well as she knew her father , \n",
      "was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able \n",
      "to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they \n",
      "left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic \n",
      "comfort , or saw her go away in the evening \n",
      "attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her \n",
      "own . But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "'s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , `` \n",
      "Ah , poor Miss Taylor ! She would be very \n",
      "glad to stay . '' There was no recovering Miss \n",
      "Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her \n",
      "; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse . The compliments of his neighbours were over ; \n",
      "he was no longer teased by being wished joy of \n",
      "so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding-cake , which \n",
      "had been a great distress to him , was all \n",
      "eat up . His own stomach could bear nothing rich \n",
      ", and he could never believe other people to be \n",
      "different from himself . What was unwholesome to him he \n",
      "regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had \n",
      ", therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having \n",
      "any wedding-cake at all , and when that proved vain \n",
      ", as earnestly tried to prevent any body 's eating \n",
      "it . He had been at the pains of consulting \n",
      "Mr. Perry , the apothecary , on the subject . \n",
      "Mr. Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose \n",
      "frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "'s life ; and upon being applied to , he \n",
      "could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against \n",
      "the bias of inclination ) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree \n",
      "with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken \n",
      "moderately . With such an opinion , in confirmation of \n",
      "his own , Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor \n",
      "of the newly married pair ; but still the cake \n",
      "was eaten ; and there was no rest for his \n",
      "benevolent nerves till it was all gone . There was \n",
      "a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys \n",
      "being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston 's wedding-cake \n",
      "in their hands : but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe \n",
      "it . CHAPTER III Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society \n",
      "in his own way . He liked very much to \n",
      "have his friends come and see him ; and from \n",
      "various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield \n",
      ", and his good nature , from his fortune , \n",
      "his house , and his daughter , he could command \n",
      "the visits of his own little circle , in a \n",
      "great measure , as he liked . He had not \n",
      "much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his \n",
      "horror of late hours , and large dinner-parties , made \n",
      "him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit \n",
      "him on his own terms . Fortunately for him , \n",
      "Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and \n",
      "Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of \n",
      "Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such . Not unfrequently , \n",
      "through Emma 's persuasion , he had some of the \n",
      "chosen and the best to dine with him : but \n",
      "evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless \n",
      "he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , \n",
      "there was scarcely an evening in the week in which \n",
      "Emma could not make up a card-table for him . \n",
      "Real , long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley \n",
      "; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living \n",
      "alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any \n",
      "vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies \n",
      "and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing-room , and the \n",
      "smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger \n",
      "of being thrown away . After these came a second \n",
      "set ; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. \n",
      "and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies \n",
      "almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield \n",
      ", and who were fetched and carried home so often \n",
      ", that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either \n",
      "James or the horses . Had it taken place only \n",
      "once a year , it would have been a grievance \n",
      ". Mrs. Bates , the widow of a former vicar \n",
      "of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost \n",
      "past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived \n",
      "with her single daughter in a very small way , \n",
      "and was considered with all the regard and respect which \n",
      "a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , \n",
      "can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree \n",
      "of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , \n",
      "rich , nor married . Miss Bates stood in the \n",
      "very worst predicament in the world for having much of \n",
      "the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority \n",
      "to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who \n",
      "might hate her into outward respect . She had never \n",
      "boasted either beauty or cleverness . Her youth had passed \n",
      "without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted \n",
      "to the care of a failing mother , and the \n",
      "endeavour to make a small income go as far as \n",
      "possible . And yet she was a happy woman , \n",
      "and a woman whom no one named without good-will . \n",
      "It was her own universal good-will and contented temper which \n",
      "worked such wonders . She loved every body , was \n",
      "interested in every body 's happiness , quicksighted to every \n",
      "body 's merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature \n",
      ", and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother \n",
      ", and so many good neighbours and friends , and \n",
      "a home that wanted for nothing . The simplicity and \n",
      "cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit \n",
      ", were a recommendation to every body , and a \n",
      "mine of felicity to herself . She was a great \n",
      "talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      ", full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . Mrs. \n",
      "Goddard was the mistress of a School -- not of \n",
      "a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing \n",
      "which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , \n",
      "to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new \n",
      "principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for \n",
      "enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into \n",
      "vanity -- but a real , honest , old-fashioned Boarding-school \n",
      ", where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at \n",
      "a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent \n",
      "to be out of the way , and scramble themselves \n",
      "into a little education , without any danger of coming \n",
      "back prodigies . Mrs. Goddard 's school was in high \n",
      "repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned \n",
      "a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house \n",
      "and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food \n",
      ", let them run about a great deal in the \n",
      "summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her \n",
      "own hands . It was no wonder that a train \n",
      "of twenty young couple now walked after her to church \n",
      ". She was a plain , motherly kind of woman \n",
      ", who had worked hard in her youth , and \n",
      "now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a \n",
      "tea-visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "'s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to \n",
      "leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy-work , \n",
      "whenever she could , and win or lose a few \n",
      "sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom \n",
      "Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and \n",
      "happy was she , for her father 's sake , \n",
      "in the power ; though , as far as she \n",
      "was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the \n",
      "absence of Mrs. Weston . She was delighted to see \n",
      "her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with \n",
      "herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet \n",
      "prosings of three such women made her feel that every \n",
      "evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings \n",
      "she had fearfully anticipated . As she sat one morning \n",
      ", looking forward to exactly such a close of the \n",
      "present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard \n",
      ", requesting , in most respectful terms , to be \n",
      "allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most \n",
      "welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of \n",
      "seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , \n",
      "and had long felt an interest in , on account \n",
      "of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned \n",
      ", and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair \n",
      "mistress of the mansion . Harriet Smith was the natural \n",
      "daughter of somebody . Somebody had placed her , several \n",
      "years back , at Mrs. Goddard 's school , and \n",
      "somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar \n",
      "to that of parlour-boarder . This was all that was \n",
      "generally known of her history . She had no visible \n",
      "friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and \n",
      "was now just returned from a long visit in the \n",
      "country to some young ladies who had been at school \n",
      "there with her . She was a very pretty girl \n",
      ", and her beauty happened to be of a sort \n",
      "which Emma particularly admired . She was short , plump \n",
      ", and fair , with a fine bloom , blue \n",
      "eyes , light hair , regular features , and a \n",
      "look of great sweetness , and , before the end \n",
      "of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with \n",
      "her manners as her person , and quite determined to \n",
      "continue the acquaintance . She was not struck by any \n",
      "thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation , but she \n",
      "found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , \n",
      "not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from \n",
      "pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , \n",
      "seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , \n",
      "and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing \n",
      "in so superior a style to what she had been \n",
      "used to , that she must have good sense , \n",
      "and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those \n",
      "soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , \n",
      "should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury \n",
      "and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed \n",
      "were unworthy of her . The friends from whom she \n",
      "had just parted , though very good sort of people \n",
      ", must be doing her harm . They were a \n",
      "family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well \n",
      "knew by character , as renting a large farm of \n",
      "Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell \n",
      "-- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr. \n",
      "Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be \n",
      "coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the \n",
      "intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more \n",
      "knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _She_ would \n",
      "notice her ; she would improve her ; she would \n",
      "detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her \n",
      "into good society ; she would form her opinions and \n",
      "her manners . It would be an interesting , and \n",
      "certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own \n",
      "situation in life , her leisure , and powers . \n",
      "She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes \n",
      ", in talking and listening , and forming all these \n",
      "schemes in the in-betweens , that the evening flew away \n",
      "at a very unusual rate ; and the supper-table , \n",
      "which always closed such parties , and for which she \n",
      "had been used to sit and watch the due time \n",
      ", was all set out and ready , and moved \n",
      "forwards to the fire , before she was aware . \n",
      "With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit \n",
      "which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing \n",
      "every thing well and attentively , with the real good-will \n",
      "of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did \n",
      "she then do all the honours of the meal , \n",
      "and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters \n",
      ", with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable \n",
      "to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests \n",
      ". Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in \n",
      "sad warfare . He loved to have the cloth laid \n",
      ", because it had been the fashion of his youth \n",
      ", but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made \n",
      "him rather sorry to see any thing put on it \n",
      "; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors \n",
      "to every thing , his care for their health made \n",
      "him grieve that they would eat . Such another small \n",
      "basin of thin gruel as his own was all that \n",
      "he could , with thorough self-approbation , recommend ; though \n",
      "he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably \n",
      "clearing the nicer things , to say : '' Mrs. \n",
      "Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of \n",
      "these eggs . An egg boiled very soft is not \n",
      "unwholesome . Serle understands boiling an egg better than any \n",
      "body . I would not recommend an egg boiled by \n",
      "any body else ; but you need not be afraid \n",
      ", they are very small , you see -- one \n",
      "of our small eggs will not hurt you . Miss \n",
      "Bates , let Emma help you to a _little_ bit \n",
      "of tart -- a _very_ little bit . Ours are \n",
      "all apple-tarts . You need not be afraid of unwholesome \n",
      "preserves here . I do not advise the custard . \n",
      "Mrs. Goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass \n",
      "of wine ? A _small_ half-glass , put into a \n",
      "tumbler of water ? I do not think it could \n",
      "disagree with you . '' Emma allowed her father to \n",
      "talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more \n",
      "satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular \n",
      "pleasure in sending them away happy . The happiness of \n",
      "Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions . Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that \n",
      "the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic \n",
      "as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl \n",
      "went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the \n",
      "affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the \n",
      "evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last \n",
      "! CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith 's intimacy at Hartfield was \n",
      "soon a settled thing . Quick and decided in her \n",
      "ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging \n",
      ", and telling her to come very often ; and \n",
      "as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in \n",
      "each other . As a walking companion , Emma had \n",
      "very early foreseen how useful she might find her . \n",
      "In that respect Mrs. Weston 's loss had been important \n",
      ". Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where \n",
      "two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long \n",
      "walk , or his short , as the year varied \n",
      "; and since Mrs. Weston 's marriage her exercise had \n",
      "been too much confined . She had ventured once alone \n",
      "to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and \n",
      "a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could \n",
      "summon at any time to a walk , would be \n",
      "a valuable addition to her privileges . But in every \n",
      "respect , as she saw more of her , she \n",
      "approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind \n",
      "designs . Harriet certainly was not clever , but she \n",
      "had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was \n",
      "totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be \n",
      "guided by any one she looked up to . Her \n",
      "early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her \n",
      "inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what \n",
      "was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no \n",
      "want of taste , though strength of understanding must not \n",
      "be expected . Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet \n",
      "Smith 's being exactly the young friend she wanted -- \n",
      "exactly the something which her home required . Such a \n",
      "friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question . \n",
      "Two such could never be granted . Two such she \n",
      "did not want . It was quite a different sort \n",
      "of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . Mrs. \n",
      "Weston was the object of a regard which had its \n",
      "basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved \n",
      "as one to whom she could be useful . For \n",
      "Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done ; for \n",
      "Harriet every thing . Her first attempts at usefulness were \n",
      "in an endeavour to find out who were the parents \n",
      ", but Harriet could not tell . She was ready \n",
      "to tell every thing in her power , but on \n",
      "this subject questions were vain . Emma was obliged to \n",
      "fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe \n",
      "that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered \n",
      "the truth . Harriet had no penetration . She had \n",
      "been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard \n",
      "chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . \n",
      "Mrs. Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls \n",
      "and the affairs of the school in general , formed \n",
      "naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but \n",
      "for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm , \n",
      "it must have been the whole . But the Martins \n",
      "occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent \n",
      "two very happy months with them , and now loved \n",
      "to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and \n",
      "describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . \n",
      "Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture \n",
      "of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful \n",
      "simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. \n",
      "Martin 's having `` _two_ parlours , two very good \n",
      "parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large \n",
      "as Mrs. Goddard 's drawing-room ; and of her having \n",
      "an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her \n",
      "; and of their having eight cows , two of \n",
      "them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , \n",
      "a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of \n",
      "Mrs. Martin 's saying as she was so fond of \n",
      "it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and \n",
      "of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden \n",
      ", where some day next year they were all to \n",
      "drink tea : -- a very handsome summer-house , large \n",
      "enough to hold a dozen people . '' For some \n",
      "time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate \n",
      "cause ; but as she came to understand the family \n",
      "better , other feelings arose . She had taken up \n",
      "a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and \n",
      "daughter , a son and son 's wife , who \n",
      "all lived together ; but when it appeared that the \n",
      "Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative \n",
      ", and was always mentioned with approbation for his great \n",
      "good-nature in doing something or other , was a single \n",
      "man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , \n",
      "no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger \n",
      "to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and \n",
      "kindness , and that , if she were not taken \n",
      "care of , she might be required to sink herself \n",
      "forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased \n",
      "in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet \n",
      "to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was \n",
      "evidently no dislike to it . Harriet was very ready \n",
      "to speak of the share he had had in their \n",
      "moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a \n",
      "good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging \n",
      ". He had gone three miles round one day in \n",
      "order to bring her some walnuts , because she had \n",
      "said how fond she was of them , and in \n",
      "every thing else he was so very obliging . He \n",
      "had his shepherd 's son into the parlour one night \n",
      "on purpose to sing to her . She was very \n",
      "fond of singing . He could sing a little himself \n",
      ". She believed he was very clever , and understood \n",
      "every thing . He had a very fine flock , \n",
      "and , while she was with them , he had \n",
      "been bid more for his wool than any body in \n",
      "the country . She believed every body spoke well of \n",
      "him . His mother and sisters were very fond of \n",
      "him . Mrs. Martin had told her one day ( \n",
      "and there was a blush as she said it , \n",
      ") that it was impossible for any body to be \n",
      "a better son , and therefore she was sure , \n",
      "whenever he married , he would make a good husband \n",
      ". Not that she _wanted_ him to marry . She \n",
      "was in no hurry at all . `` Well done \n",
      ", Mrs . Martin ! '' thought Emma . `` \n",
      "You know what you are about . '' `` And \n",
      "when she had come away , Mrs. Martin was so \n",
      "very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose \n",
      "-- the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen . \n",
      "Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and \n",
      "asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and \n",
      "Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with \n",
      "her . '' `` Mr. Martin , I suppose , \n",
      "is not a man of information beyond the line of \n",
      "his own business ? He does not read ? '' \n",
      "`` Oh yes ! -- that is , no -- \n",
      "I do not know -- but I believe he has \n",
      "read a good deal -- but not what you would \n",
      "think any thing of . He reads the Agricultural Reports \n",
      ", and some other books that lay in one of \n",
      "the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to \n",
      "himself . But sometimes of an evening , before we \n",
      "went to cards , he would read something aloud out \n",
      "of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining . And I \n",
      "know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield . He \n",
      "never read the Romance of the Forest , nor The \n",
      "Children of the Abbey . He had never heard of \n",
      "such books before I mentioned them , but he is \n",
      "determined to get them now as soon as ever he \n",
      "can . '' The next question was -- '' What \n",
      "sort of looking man is Mr . Martin ? '' \n",
      "`` Oh ! not handsome -- not at all handsome \n",
      ". I thought him very plain at first , but \n",
      "I do not think him so plain now . One \n",
      "does not , you know , after a time . \n",
      "But did you never see him ? He is in \n",
      "Highbury every now and then , and he is sure \n",
      "to ride through every week in his way to Kingston \n",
      ". He has passed you very often . '' `` \n",
      "That may be , and I may have seen him \n",
      "fifty times , but without having any idea of his \n",
      "name . A young farmer , whether on horseback or \n",
      "on foot , is the very last sort of person \n",
      "to raise my curiosity . The yeomanry are precisely the \n",
      "order of people with whom I feel I can have \n",
      "nothing to do . A degree or two lower , \n",
      "and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might \n",
      "hope to be useful to their families in some way \n",
      "or other . But a farmer can need none of \n",
      "my help , and is , therefore , in one \n",
      "sense , as much above my notice as in every \n",
      "other he is below it . '' `` To be \n",
      "sure . Oh yes ! It is not likely you \n",
      "should ever have observed him ; but he knows you \n",
      "very well indeed -- I mean by sight . '' \n",
      "`` I have no doubt of his being a very \n",
      "respectable young man . I know , indeed , that \n",
      "he is so , and , as such , wish \n",
      "him well . What do you imagine his age to \n",
      "be ? '' `` He was four-and-twenty the 8th of \n",
      "last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just \n",
      "a fortnight and a day 's difference -- which is \n",
      "very odd . '' `` Only four-and-twenty . That is \n",
      "too young to settle . His mother is perfectly right \n",
      "not to be in a hurry . They seem very \n",
      "comfortable as they are , and if she were to \n",
      "take any pains to marry him , she would probably \n",
      "repent it . Six years hence , if he could \n",
      "meet with a good sort of young woman in the \n",
      "same rank as his own , with a little money \n",
      ", it might be very desirable . '' `` Six \n",
      "years hence ! Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be \n",
      "thirty years old ! '' `` Well , and that \n",
      "is as early as most men can afford to marry \n",
      ", who are not born to an independence . Mr. \n",
      "Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to \n",
      "make -- can not be at all beforehand with the \n",
      "world . Whatever money he might come into when his \n",
      "father died , whatever his share of the family property \n",
      ", it is , I dare say , all afloat \n",
      ", all employed in his stock , and so forth \n",
      "; and though , with diligence and good luck , \n",
      "he may be rich in time , it is next \n",
      "to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet \n",
      ". '' `` To be sure , so it is \n",
      ". But they live very comfortably . They have no \n",
      "indoors man , else they do not want for any \n",
      "thing ; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy \n",
      "another year . '' `` I wish you may not \n",
      "get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does \n",
      "marry ; -- I mean , as to being acquainted \n",
      "with his wife -- for though his sisters , from \n",
      "a superior education , are not to be altogether objected \n",
      "to , it does not follow that he might marry \n",
      "any body at all fit for you to notice . \n",
      "The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly \n",
      "careful as to your associates . There can be no \n",
      "doubt of your being a gentleman 's daughter , and \n",
      "you must support your claim to that station by every \n",
      "thing within your own power , or there will be \n",
      "plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you \n",
      ". '' `` Yes , to be sure , I \n",
      "suppose there are . But while I visit at Hartfield \n",
      ", and you are so kind to me , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body \n",
      "can do . '' `` You understand the force of \n",
      "influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have \n",
      "you so firmly established in good society , as to \n",
      "be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse . I \n",
      "want to see you permanently well connected , and to \n",
      "that end it will be advisable to have as few \n",
      "odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , \n",
      "I say that if you should still be in this \n",
      "country when Mr. Martin marries , I wish you may \n",
      "not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters \n",
      ", to be acquainted with the wife , who will \n",
      "probably be some mere farmer 's daughter , without education \n",
      ". '' `` To be sure . Yes . Not \n",
      "that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body \n",
      "but what had had some education -- and been very \n",
      "well brought up . However , I do not mean \n",
      "to set up my opinion against your 's -- and \n",
      "I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance \n",
      "of his wife . I shall always have a great \n",
      "regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and \n",
      "should be very sorry to give them up , for \n",
      "they are quite as well educated as me . But \n",
      "if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , \n",
      "certainly I had better not visit her , if I \n",
      "can help it . '' Emma watched her through the \n",
      "fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms \n",
      "of love . The young man had been the first \n",
      "admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold \n",
      ", and that there would be no serious difficulty , \n",
      "on Harriet 's side , to oppose any friendly arrangement \n",
      "of her own . They met Mr. Martin the very \n",
      "next day , as they were walking on the Donwell \n",
      "road . He was on foot , and after looking \n",
      "very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction \n",
      "at her companion . Emma was not sorry to have \n",
      "such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few \n",
      "yards forward , while they talked together , soon made \n",
      "her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin . \n",
      "His appearance was very neat , and he looked like \n",
      "a sensible young man , but his person had no \n",
      "other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted \n",
      "with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the \n",
      "ground he had gained in Harriet 's inclination . Harriet \n",
      "was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed \n",
      "her father 's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder \n",
      ". Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know \n",
      "what manner was . They remained but a few minutes \n",
      "together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting \n",
      "; and Harriet then came running to her with a \n",
      "smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , \n",
      "which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose . `` \n",
      "Only think of our happening to meet him ! -- \n",
      "How very odd ! It was quite a chance , \n",
      "he said , that he had not gone round by \n",
      "Randalls . He did not think we ever walked this \n",
      "road . He thought we walked towards Randalls most days \n",
      ". He has not been able to get the Romance \n",
      "of the Forest yet . He was so busy the \n",
      "last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot \n",
      "it , but he goes again to-morrow . So very \n",
      "odd we should happen to meet ! Well , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? What \n",
      "do you think of him ? Do you think him \n",
      "so very plain ? '' `` He is very plain \n",
      ", undoubtedly -- remarkably plain : -- but that is \n",
      "nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . I \n",
      "had no right to expect much , and I did \n",
      "not expect much ; but I had no idea that \n",
      "he could be so very clownish , so totally without \n",
      "air . I had imagined him , I confess , \n",
      "a degree or two nearer gentility . '' `` To \n",
      "be sure , '' said Harriet , in a mortified \n",
      "voice , `` he is not so genteel as real \n",

      "now ? Were not you struck ? I am sure \n",
      "you must have been struck by his awkward look and \n",
      "abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which \n",
      "I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here \n",
      ". '' `` Certainly , he is not like Mr. \n",
      "Knightley . He has not such a fine air and \n",
      "way of walking as Mr. Knightley . I see the \n",

      "youth is detestable in later age . Mr. Martin is \n",
      "now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at \n",
      "Mr. Weston 's time of life ? '' `` There \n",
      "is no saying , indeed , '' replied Harriet rather \n",
      "solemnly . `` But there may be pretty good guessing \n",

      ", totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing \n",

      "indeed ? That will be very bad . '' `` \n",
      "How much his business engrosses him already is very plain \n",

      "full of the market to think of any thing else \n",
      "-- which is just as it should be , for \n",
      "a thriving man . What has he to do with \n",
      "books ? And I have no doubt that he _will_ \n",

      "-- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb \n",
      "_us_ . '' `` I wonder he did not remember \n",
      "the book '' -- was all Harriet 's answer , \n",
      "and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma \n",
      "thought might be safely left to itself . She , \n",
      "therefore , said no more for some time . Her \n",

      ", Mr. Elton 's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley \n",
      "'s or Mr. Weston 's . They have more gentleness \n",
      ". They might be more safely held up as a \n",

      "almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston , which every body \n",
      "likes in _him_ , because there is so much good-humour \n",
      "with it -- but that would not do to be \n",
      "copied . Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright , decided , \n",
      "commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very \n",
      "well ; his figure , and look , and situation \n",
      "in life seem to allow it ; but if any \n",

      "good-humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . He \n",
      "seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late \n",

      "of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , \n",
      "by additional softness , but it strikes me that his \n",
      "manners are softer than they used to be . If \n",
      "he means any thing , it must be to please \n",
      "you . Did not I tell you what he said \n",
      "of you the other day ? '' She then repeated \n",
      "some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. \n",
      "Elton , and now did full justice to ; and \n",
      "Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always \n",
      "thought Mr. Elton very agreeable . Mr. Elton was the \n",
      "very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young \n",
      "farmer out of Harriet 's head . She thought it \n",
      "would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably \n",
      "desirable , natural , and probable , for her to \n",
      "have much merit in planning it . She feared it \n",
      "was what every body else must think of and predict \n",
      ". It was not likely , however , that any \n",

      "very first evening of Harriet 's coming to Hartfield . \n",
      "The longer she considered it , the greater was her \n",
      "sense of its expediency . Mr. Elton 's situation was \n",

      "low connexions ; at the same time , not of \n",
      "any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth \n",
      "of Harriet . He had a comfortable home for her \n",

      "weight and efficacy . And he was really a very \n",

      "your own battle . '' `` Mr. Weston would undoubtedly \n",
      "support me , if he were here , for he \n",
      "thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We \n",
      "were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how \n",
      "fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be \n",
      "such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with \n",
      ". Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to \n",
      "be a fair judge in this case . You are \n",
      "so much used to live alone , that you do \n",
      "not know the value of a companion ; and , \n",
      "perhaps no man can be a good judge of the \n",
      "comfort a woman feels in the society of one of \n",
      "her own sex , after being used to it all \n",
      "her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet \n",
      "Smith . She is not the superior young woman which \n",
      "Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the \n",
      "other hand , as Emma wants to see her better \n",
      "informed , it will be an inducement to her to \n",
      "read more herself . They will read together . She \n",
      "means it , I know . '' `` Emma has \n",
      "been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve \n",
      "years old . I have seen a great many lists \n",
      "of her drawing-up at various times of books that she \n",
      "meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists \n",
      "they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly \n",
      "arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other \n",
      "rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen \n",
      "-- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much \n",
      "credit , that I preserved it some time ; and \n",
      "I dare say she may have made out a very \n",
      "good list now . But I have done with expecting \n",
      "any course of steady reading from Emma . She will \n",
      "never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , \n",
      "and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . \n",
      "Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely \n",
      "affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing. -- You never \n",
      "could persuade her to read half so much as you \n",
      "wished. -- You know you could not . '' `` \n",
      "I dare say , '' replied Mrs. Weston , smiling \n",
      ", `` that I thought so _then_ ; -- but \n",
      "since we have parted , I can never remember Emma's \n",
      "omitting to do any thing I wished . '' `` \n",
      "There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory \n",
      "as _that_ , '' -- said Mr. Knightley , feelingly \n",
      "; and for a moment or two he had done \n",
      ". `` But I , '' he soon added , \n",
      "`` who have had no such charm thrown over my \n",
      "senses , must still see , hear , and remember \n",
      ". Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her \n",
      "family . At ten years old , she had the \n",
      "misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her \n",
      "sister at seventeen . She was always quick and assured \n",
      ": Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she \n",
      "was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house \n",
      "and of you all . In her mother she lost \n",
      "the only person able to cope with her . She \n",
      "inherits her mother 's talents , and must have been \n",
      "under subjection to her . '' `` I should have \n",
      "been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on \n",
      "_your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse 's family \n",
      "and wanted another situation ; I do not think you \n",
      "would have spoken a good word for me to any \n",
      "body . I am sure you always thought me unfit \n",
      "for the office I held . '' `` Yes , \n",
      "'' said he , smiling . `` You are better \n",
      "placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but \n",
      "not at all for a governess . But you were \n",
      "preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time \n",
      "you were at Hartfield . You might not give Emma \n",
      "such a complete education as your powers would seem to \n",
      "promise ; but you were receiving a very good education \n",
      "from _her_ , on the very material matrimonial point of \n",
      "submitting your own will , and doing as you were \n",
      "bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend \n",
      "him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss \n",
      "Taylor . '' `` Thank you . There will be \n",
      "very little merit in making a good wife to such \n",
      "a man as Mr . Weston . '' `` Why \n",
      ", to own the truth , I am afraid you \n",
      "are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition \n",
      "to bear , there will be nothing to be borne \n",
      ". We will not despair , however . Weston may \n",
      "grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his \n",
      "son may plague him . '' `` I hope not \n",
      "_that_. -- It is not likely . No , Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter . \n",
      "'' `` Not I , indeed . I only name \n",
      "possibilities . I do not pretend to Emma's genius for \n",
      "foretelling and guessing . I hope , with all my \n",
      "heart , the young man may be a Weston in \n",
      "merit , and a Churchill in fortune. -- But Harriet \n",
      "Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith \n",
      ". I think her the very worst sort of companion \n",
      "that Emma could possibly have . She knows nothing herself \n",
      ", and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing . \n",
      "She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and \n",
      "so much the worse , because undesigned . Her ignorance \n",
      "is hourly flattery . How can Emma imagine she has \n",
      "any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting \n",
      "such a delightful inferiority ? And as for Harriet , \n",
      "I will venture to say that _she_ can not gain \n",
      "by the acquaintance . Hartfield will only put her out \n",
      "of conceit with all the other places she belongs to \n",
      ". She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable \n",
      "with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her \n",
      "home . I am much mistaken if Emma 's doctrines \n",
      "give any strength of mind , or tend at all \n",
      "to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties \n",
      "of her situation in life. -- They only give a \n",
      "little polish . '' `` I either depend more upon \n",
      "Emma 's good sense than you do , or am \n",
      "more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can \n",
      "not lament the acquaintance . How well she looked last \n",
      "night ! '' `` Oh ! you would rather talk \n",
      "of her person than her mind , would you ? \n",
      "Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma \n",
      "'s being pretty . '' `` Pretty ! say beautiful \n",
      "rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty \n",
      "than Emma altogether -- face and figure ? '' `` \n",
      "I do not know what I could imagine , but \n",
      "I confess that I have seldom seen a face or \n",
      "figure more pleasing to me than hers . But I \n",
      "am a partial old friend . '' `` Such an \n",
      "eye ! -- the true hazle eye -- and so \n",
      "brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a \n",
      "complexion ! oh ! what a bloom of full health \n",
      ", and such a pretty height and size ; such \n",
      "a firm and upright figure ! There is health , \n",
      "not merely in her bloom , but in her air \n",
      ", her head , her glance . One hears sometimes \n",
      "of a child being ` the picture of health ; \n",
      "' now , Emma always gives me the idea of \n",

      "for . It would not be a bad thing for \n",
      "her to be very much in love with a proper \n",
      "object . I should like to see Emma in love \n",
      ", and in some doubt of a return ; it \n",
      "would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts \n",
      "to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from \n",

      "as little to tempt her to break her resolution at \n",
      "present , '' said Mrs. Weston , `` as can \n",
      "well be ; and while she is so happy at \n",
      "Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming \n",
      "any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse 's account . I do not recommend matrimony \n",
      "at present to Emma , though I mean no slight \n",
      "to the state , I assure you . '' Part \n",
      "of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of \n",
      "her own and Mr. Weston 's on the subject , \n",
      "as much as possible . There were wishes at Randalls \n",
      "respecting Emma 's destiny , but it was not desirable \n",
      "to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which \n",
      "Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to `` What does Weston \n",
      "think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? \n",
      "'' convinced her that he had nothing more to say \n",
      "or surmise about Hartfield . CHAPTER VI Emma could not \n",
      "feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a \n",
      "proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity \n",
      "to a very good purpose , for she found her \n",
      "decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being \n",
      "a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; \n",
      "and as she had no hesitation in following up the \n",
      "assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was \n",
      "soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet \n",
      "'s side , as there could be any occasion for \n",
      ". She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton 's being \n",
      "in the fairest way of falling in love , if \n",
      "not in love already . She had no scruple with \n",
      "regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and \n",
      "praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose \n",
      "any thing wanting which a little time would not add \n",
      ". His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet 's \n",
      "manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not \n",
      "one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment \n",
      ". `` You have given Miss Smith all that she \n",
      "required , '' said he ; '' you have made \n",
      "her graceful and easy . She was a beautiful creature \n",
      "when she came to you , but , in my \n",
      "opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior \n",
      "to what she received from nature . '' `` I \n",
      "am glad you think I have been useful to her \n",
      "; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving \n",
      "a few , very few hints . She had all \n",
      "the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in \n",
      "herself . I have done very little . '' `` \n",
      "If it were admissible to contradict a lady , '' \n",
      "said the gallant Mr. Elton -- '' I have perhaps \n",
      "given her a little more decision of character , have \n",
      "taught her to think on points which had not fallen \n",
      "in her way before . '' `` Exactly so ; \n",
      "that is what principally strikes me . So much superadded \n",
      "decision of character ! Skilful has been the hand ! \n",
      "'' `` Great has been the pleasure , I am \n",
      "sure . I never met with a disposition more truly \n",
      "amiable . '' `` I have no doubt of it \n",
      ". '' And it was spoken with a sort of \n",
      "sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the \n",
      "lover . She was not less pleased another day with \n",
      "the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of \n",
      "hers , to have Harriet 's picture . `` Did \n",
      "you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ? '' \n",
      "said she : `` did you ever sit for your \n",
      "picture ? '' Harriet was on the point of leaving \n",
      "the room , and only stopt to say , with \n",
      "a very interesting naivete , '' Oh ! dear , \n",
      "no , never . '' No sooner was she out \n",
      "of sight , than Emma exclaimed , '' What an \n",
      "exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! \n",
      "I would give any money for it . I almost \n",
      "long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not \n",
      "know it I dare say , but two or three \n",
      "years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses \n",
      ", and attempted several of my friends , and was \n",
      "thought to have a tolerable eye in general . But \n",
      "from one cause or another , I gave it up \n",
      "in disgust . But really , I could almost venture \n",
      ", if Harriet would sit to me . It would \n",
      "be such a delight to have her picture ! '' \n",
      "`` Let me entreat you , '' cried Mr. Elton \n",
      "; `` it would indeed be a delight ! Let \n",
      "me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so \n",
      "charming a talent in favour of your friend . I \n",
      "know what your drawings are . How could you suppose \n",
      "me ignorant ? Is not this room rich in specimens \n",
      "of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. \n",
      "Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room , at Randalls \n",
      "? '' Yes , good man ! -- thought Emma \n",
      "-- but what has all that to do with taking \n",
      "likenesses ? You know nothing of drawing . Do n't \n",
      "pretend to be in raptures about mine . Keep your \n",
      "raptures for Harriet 's face . `` Well , if \n",
      "you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , \n",
      "I believe I shall try what I can do . \n",
      "Harriet 's features are very delicate , which makes a \n",
      "likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in \n",
      "the shape of the eye and the lines about the \n",
      "mouth which one ought to catch . '' `` Exactly \n",
      "so -- The shape of the eye and the lines \n",
      "about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of \n",
      "your success . Pray , pray attempt it . As \n",
      "you will do it , it will indeed , to \n",
      "use your own words , be an exquisite possession . \n",
      "'' `` But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , \n",
      "Harriet will not like to sit . She thinks so \n",
      "little of her own beauty . Did not you observe \n",
      "her manner of answering me ? How completely it meant \n",
      ", ` why should my picture be drawn ? ' \n",
      "'' `` Oh ! yes , I observed it , \n",
      "I assure you . It was not lost on me \n",
      ". But still I can not imagine she would not \n",
      "be persuaded . '' Harriet was soon back again , \n",
      "and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had \n",
      "no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest \n",
      "pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go \n",
      "to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing \n",
      "her various attempts at portraits , for not one of \n",
      "them had ever been finished , that they might decide \n",
      "together on the best size for Harriet . Her many \n",
      "beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half-lengths , whole-lengths , \n",
      "pencil , crayon , and water-colours had been all tried \n",
      "in turn . She had always wanted to do every \n",
      "thing , and had made more progress both in drawing \n",
      "and music than many might have done with so little \n",
      "labour as she would ever submit to . She played \n",
      "and sang ; -- and drew in almost every style \n",
      "; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in \n",
      "nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she \n",
      "would have been glad to command , and ought not \n",
      "to have failed of . She was not much deceived \n",
      "as to her own skill either as an artist or \n",
      "a musician , but she was not unwilling to have \n",
      "others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for \n",
      "accomplishment often higher than it deserved . There was merit \n",
      "in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps \n",
      "the most ; her style was spirited ; but had \n",
      "there been much less , or had there been ten \n",
      "times more , the delight and admiration of her two \n",
      "companions would have been the same . They were both \n",
      "in ecstasies . A likeness pleases every body ; and \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse 's performances must be capital . `` No \n",
      "great variety of faces for you , '' said Emma \n",
      ". `` I had only my own family to study \n",
      "from . There is my father -- another of my \n",
      "father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture \n",
      "made him so nervous , that I could only take \n",
      "him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore \n",
      ". Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again \n",
      ", you see . Dear Mrs. Weston ! always my \n",
      "kindest friend on every occasion . She would sit whenever \n",
      "I asked her . There is my sister ; and \n",
      "really quite her own little elegant figure ! -- and \n",
      "the face not unlike . I should have made a \n",
      "good likeness of her , if she would have sat \n",
      "longer , but she was in such a hurry to \n",
      "have me draw her four children that she would not \n",
      "be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts \n",
      "at three of those four children ; -- there they \n",
      "are , Henry and John and Bella , from one \n",
      "end of the sheet to the other , and any \n",
      "one of them might do for any one of the \n",
      "rest . She was so eager to have them drawn \n",
      "that I could not refuse ; but there is no \n",
      "making children of three or four years old stand still \n",
      "you know ; nor can it be very easy to \n",
      "take any likeness of them , beyond the air and \n",
      "complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of \n",
      "mama 's children ever were . Here is my sketch \n",
      "of the fourth , who was a baby . I \n",
      "took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , \n",
      "and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade \n",
      "as you would wish to see . He had nestled \n",
      "down his head most conveniently . That 's very like \n",
      ". I am rather proud of little George . The \n",
      "corner of the sofa is very good . Then here \n",
      "is my last , '' -- unclosing a pretty sketch \n",
      "of a gentleman in small size , whole-length -- '' \n",
      "my last and my best -- my brother , Mr. \n",
      "John Knightley. -- This did not want much of being \n",
      "finished , when I put it away in a pet \n",
      ", and vowed I would never take another likeness . \n",
      "I could not help being provoked ; for after all \n",
      "my pains , and when I had really made a \n",
      "very good likeness of it -- ( Mrs. Weston and \n",
      "I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like ) \n",
      "-- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that \n",
      "was a fault on the right side -- after all \n",
      "this , came poor dear Isabella 's cold approbation of \n",
      "-- '' Yes , it was a little like -- \n",
      "but to be sure it did not do him justice \n",
      ". '' We had had a great deal of trouble \n",
      "in persuading him to sit at all . It was \n",
      "made a great favour of ; and altogether it was \n",
      "more than I could bear ; and so I never \n",
      "would finish it , to have it apologised over as \n",
      "an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick \n",
      "Square ; -- and , as I said , I \n",
      "did then forswear ever drawing any body again . But \n",
      "for Harriet 's sake , or rather for my own \n",
      ", and as there are no husbands and wives in \n",
      "the case _at_ _present_ , I will break my resolution \n",
      "now . '' Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and \n",
      "delighted by the idea , and was repeating , `` \n",
      "No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed \n",
      ", as you observe . Exactly so . No husbands \n",
      "and wives , '' with so interesting a consciousness , \n",
      "that Emma began to consider whether she had not better \n",
      "leave them together at once . But as she wanted \n",
      "to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little \n",
      "longer . She had soon fixed on the size and \n",
      "sort of portrait . It was to be a whole-length \n",
      "in water-colours , like Mr. John Knightley 's , and \n",
      "was destined , if she could please herself , to \n",
      "hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The \n",
      "sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , \n",
      "and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , \n",
      "presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the \n",
      "steady eyes of the artist . But there was no \n",
      "doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her \n",
      "and watching every touch . She gave him credit for \n",
      "stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without \n",
      "offence ; but was really obliged to put an end \n",
      "to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere \n",
      ". It then occurred to her to employ him in \n",
      "reading . `` If he would be so good as \n",
      "to read to them , it would be a kindness \n",
      "indeed ! It would amuse away the difficulties of her \n",
      "part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith 's \n",
      ". '' Mr. Elton was only too happy . Harriet \n",
      "listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must \n",
      "allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; \n",
      "any thing less would certainly have been too little in \n",
      "a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest \n",
      "intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see \n",
      "the progress , and be charmed. -- There was no \n",
      "being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration \n",
      "made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible \n",
      ". She could not respect his eye , but his \n",
      "love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was \n",
      "altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with \n",
      "the first day 's sketch to wish to go on \n",
      ". There was no want of likeness , she had \n",
      "been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant \n",
      "to throw in a little improvement to the figure , \n",
      "to give a little more height , and considerably more \n",
      "elegance , she had great confidence of its being in \n",
      "every way a pretty drawing at last , and of \n",
      "its filling its destined place with credit to them both \n",
      "-- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , \n",
      "the skill of the other , and the friendship of \n",
      "both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. \n",
      "Elton 's very promising attachment was likely to add . \n",
      "Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and \n",
      "Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for \n",
      "the permission of attending and reading to them again . \n",
      "`` By all means . We shall be most happy \n",
      "to consider you as one of the party . '' \n",
      "The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and \n",
      "satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied \n",
      "the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid \n",
      "and happy . Every body who saw it was pleased \n",
      ", but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures , and \n",
      "defended it through every criticism . `` Miss Woodhouse has \n",
      "given her friend the only beauty she wanted , '' \n",
      "-- observed Mrs. Weston to him -- not in the \n",
      "least suspecting that she was addressing a lover. -- '' \n",
      "The expression of the eye is most correct , but \n",
      "Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . It \n",
      "is the fault of her face that she has them \n",
      "not . '' `` Do you think so ? '' \n",
      "replied he . `` I can not agree with you \n",
      ". It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in \n",
      "every feature . I never saw such a likeness in \n",
      "my life . We must allow for the effect of \n",
      "shade , you know . '' `` You have made \n",
      "her too tall , Emma , '' said Mr. Knightley \n",
      ". Emma knew that she had , but would not \n",
      "own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , '' \n",
      "Oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in \n",
      "the least too tall . Consider , she is sitting \n",
      "down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in \n",
      "short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must \n",
      "be preserved , you know . Proportions , fore-shortening. -- \n",
      "Oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of \n",
      "such a height as Miss Smith 's . Exactly so \n",
      "indeed ! '' `` It is very pretty , '' \n",
      "said Mr. Woodhouse . `` So prettily done ! Just \n",
      "as your drawings always are , my dear . I \n",
      "do not know any body who draws so well as \n",
      "you do . The only thing I do not thoroughly \n",
      "like is , that she seems to be sitting out \n",
      "of doors , with only a little shawl over her \n",
      "shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch \n",
      "cold . '' `` But , my dear papa , \n",
      "it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day \n",
      "in summer . Look at the tree . '' `` \n",
      "But it is never safe to sit out of doors \n",
      ", my dear . '' `` You , sir , \n",
      "may say any thing , '' cried Mr. Elton , \n",
      "`` but I must confess that I regard it as \n",
      "a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith \n",
      "out of doors ; and the tree is touched with \n",
      "such inimitable spirit ! Any other situation would have been \n",
      "much less in character . The naivete of Miss Smith \n",
      "'s manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is \n",
      "most admirable ! I can not keep my eyes from \n",
      "it . I never saw such a likeness . '' \n",
      "The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed \n",
      "; and here were a few difficulties . It must \n",
      "be done directly ; it must be done in London \n",
      "; the order must go through the hands of some \n",
      "intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and \n",
      "Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must \n",
      "not be applied to , because it was December , \n",
      "and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her \n",
      "stirring out of her house in the fogs of December \n",
      ". But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. \n",
      "Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was \n",
      "always on the alert . `` Might he be trusted \n",
      "with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have \n",
      "in executing it ! he could ride to London at \n",
      "any time . It was impossible to say how much \n",
      "he should be gratified by being employed on such an \n",
      "errand . '' `` He was too good ! -- \n",
      "she could not endure the thought ! -- she would \n",
      "not give him such a troublesome office for the world \n",
      ", '' -- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties \n",
      "and assurances , -- and a very few minutes settled \n",
      "the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing \n",
      "to London , chuse the frame , and give the \n",
      "directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it \n",
      "as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , \n",
      "while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough \n",
      ". `` What a precious deposit ! '' said he \n",
      "with a tender sigh , as he received it . \n",
      "`` This man is almost too gallant to be in \n",
      "love , '' thought Emma . `` I should say \n",
      "so , but that I suppose there may be a \n",
      "hundred different ways of being in love . He is \n",
      "an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly \n",
      "; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' \n",
      "as he says himself ; but he does sigh and \n",
      "languish , and study for compliments rather more than I \n",
      "could endure as a principal . I come in for \n",
      "a pretty good share as a second . But it \n",
      "is his gratitude on Harriet 's account . '' CHAPTER \n",
      "VII The very day of Mr. Elton 's going to \n",
      "London produced a fresh occasion for Emma 's services towards \n",
      "her friend . Harriet had been at Hartfield , as \n",
      "usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a \n",
      "time , had gone home to return again to dinner \n",
      ": she returned , and sooner than had been talked \n",
      "of , and with an agitated , hurried look , \n",
      "announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing \n",
      "to tell . Half a minute brought it all out \n",
      ". She had heard , as soon as she got \n",
      "back to Mrs. Goddard 's , that Mr. Martin had \n",
      "been there an hour before , and finding she was \n",
      "not at home , nor particularly expected , had left \n",
      "a little parcel for her from one of his sisters \n",
      ", and gone away ; and on opening this parcel \n",
      ", she had actually found , besides the two songs \n",
      "which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter \n",
      "to herself ; and this letter was from him , \n",
      "from Mr. Martin , and contained a direct proposal of \n",
      "marriage . `` Who could have thought it ? She \n",
      "was so surprized she did not know what to do \n",
      ". Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and \n",
      "a very good letter , at least she thought so \n",
      ". And he wrote as if he really loved her \n",
      "very much -- but she did not know -- and \n",
      "so , she was come as fast as she could \n",
      "to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do. -- '' \n",
      "Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased \n",
      "and so doubtful . `` Upon my word , '' \n",
      "she cried , `` the young man is determined not \n",
      "to lose any thing for want of asking . He \n",
      "will connect himself well if he can . '' `` \n",
      "Will you read the letter ? '' cried Harriet . \n",
      "`` Pray do . I 'd rather you would . \n",
      "'' Emma was not sorry to be pressed . She \n",
      "read , and was surprized . The style of the \n",
      "letter was much above her expectation . There were not \n",
      "merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it \n",
      "would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , \n",
      "though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the \n",
      "sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the \n",
      "writer . It was short , but expressed good sense \n",
      ", warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy \n",
      "of feeling . She paused over it , while Harriet \n",
      "stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a `` \n",
      "Well , well , '' and was at last forced \n",
      "to add , '' Is it a good letter ? \n",
      "or is it too short ? '' `` Yes , \n",
      "indeed , a very good letter , '' replied Emma \n",
      "rather slowly -- '' so good a letter , Harriet \n",
      ", that every thing considered , I think one of \n",
      "his sisters must have helped him . I can hardly \n",
      "imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you \n",
      "the other day could express himself so well , if \n",
      "left quite to his own powers , and yet it \n",
      "is not the style of a woman ; no , \n",
      "certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not \n",
      "diffuse enough for a woman . No doubt he is \n",
      "a sensible man , and I suppose may have a \n",
      "natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and \n",
      "when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts \n",
      "naturally find proper words . It is so with some \n",
      "men . Yes , I understand the sort of mind \n",
      ". Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain \n",
      "point , not coarse . A better written letter , \n",
      "Harriet ( returning it , ) than I had expected \n",
      ". '' `` Well , '' said the still waiting \n",
      "Harriet ; -- '' well -- and -- and what \n",
      "shall I do ? '' `` What shall you do \n",
      "! In what respect ? Do you mean with regard \n",
      "to this letter ? '' `` Yes . '' `` \n",
      "But what are you in doubt of ? You must \n",
      "answer it of course -- and speedily . '' `` \n",
      "Yes . But what shall I say ? Dear Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , do advise me . '' `` Oh no \n",
      ", no ! the letter had much better be all \n",
      "your own . You will express yourself very properly , \n",
      "I am sure . There is no danger of your \n",
      "not being intelligible , which is the first thing . \n",
      "Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs \n",
      ": and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the \n",
      "pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present \n",
      "themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , I am persuaded . \n",
      "You need not be prompted to write with the appearance \n",
      "of sorrow for his disappointment . '' `` You think \n",

      "My dear Harriet , what do you mean ? Are \n",
      "you in any doubt as to that ? I thought \n",
      "-- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have \n",

      "not mean -- What shall I do ? What would \n",

      "'' `` I shall not give you any advice , \n",
      "Harriet . I will have nothing to do with it \n",

      "your feelings . '' `` I had no notion that \n",
      "he liked me so very much , '' said Harriet \n",

      "persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the \n",
      "bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , \n",
      "she thought it best to say , '' I lay \n",
      "it down as a general rule , Harriet , that \n",
      "if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept \n",
      "a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse \n",
      "him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes \n",

      ". It is not a state to be safely entered \n",
      "into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . \n",

      "older than yourself , to say thus much to you \n",
      ". But do not imagine that I want to influence \n",
      "you . '' `` Oh ! no , I am \n",

      "ought to be quite made up -- One should not \n",
      "be hesitating -- It is a very serious thing. -- \n",
      "It will be safer to say ` No , ' \n",
      "perhaps. -- Do you think I had better say ` \n",
      "No ? ' '' `` Not for the world , \n",
      "'' said Emma , smiling graciously , `` would I \n",
      "advise you either way . You must be the best \n",
      "judge of your own happiness . If you prefer Mr. \n",
      "Martin to every other person ; if you think him \n",
      "the most agreeable man you have ever been in company \n",

      "the letter was still in her hand , it was \n",

      ". While you were in the smallest degree wavering , \n",
      "I said nothing about it , because I would not \n",
      "influence ; but it would have been the loss of \n",
      "a friend to me . I could not have visited \n",
      "Mrs. Robert Martin , of Abbey-Mill Farm . Now I \n",
      "am secure of you for ever . '' Harriet had \n",
      "not surmised her own danger , but the idea of \n",
      "it struck her forcibly . `` You could not have \n",

      "that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with \n",

      ". This letter , however , was written , and \n",
      "sealed , and sent . The business was finished , \n",
      "and Harriet safe . She was rather low all the \n",
      "evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets \n",
      ", and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own \n",
      "affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. \n",

      "this of being married . Even this conquest would appear \n",
      "valuable in her eyes . As to any thing superior \n",
      "for you , I suppose she is quite in the \n",
      "dark . The attentions of a certain person can hardly \n",
      "be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet . Hitherto I \n",
      "fancy you and I are the only people to whom \n",
      "his looks and manners have explained themselves . '' Harriet \n",
      "blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that \n",
      "people should like her so much . The idea of \n",
      "Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after \n",
      "a time , she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected \n",
      "Mr. Martin . `` Now he has got my letter \n",
      ", '' said she softly . `` I wonder what \n",
      "they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- \n",
      "if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too \n",
      ". I hope he will not mind it so very \n",
      "much . '' `` Let us think of those among \n",
      "our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , '' \n",
      "cried Emma . `` At this moment , perhaps , \n",
      "Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and \n",
      "sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original \n",
      ", and after being asked for it five or six \n",
      "times , allowing them to hear your name , your \n",
      "own dear name . '' `` My picture ! -- \n",
      "But he has left my picture in Bond-street . '' \n",
      "`` Has he so ! -- Then I know nothing \n",
      "of Mr. Elton . No , my dear little modest \n",
      "Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be \n",
      "in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow \n",
      ". It is his companion all this evening , his \n",
      "solace , his delight . It opens his designs to \n",
      "his family , it introduces you among them , it \n",
      "diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature \n",
      ", eager curiosity and warm prepossession . How cheerful , \n",
      "how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations \n",
      "all are ! '' Harriet smiled again , and her \n",
      "smiles grew stronger . CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield \n",
      "that night . For some weeks past she had been \n",
      "spending more than half her time there , and gradually \n",
      "getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself ; and \n",
      "Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and \n",
      "kindest , to keep her with them as much as \n",
      "possible just at present . She was obliged to go \n",
      "the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. \n",
      "Goddard 's , but it was then to be settled \n",
      "that she should return to Hartfield , to make a \n",
      "regular visit of some days . While she was gone \n",
      ", Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who \n",
      "had previously made up his mind to walk out , \n",
      "was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , \n",
      "and was induced by the entreaties of both , though \n",
      "against the scruples of his own civility , to leave \n",
      "Mr. Knightley for that purpose . Mr. Knightley , who \n",
      "had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by \n",
      "his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to \n",
      "the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other . \n",
      "`` Well , I believe , if you will excuse \n",
      "me , Mr. Knightley , if you will not consider \n",
      "me as doing a very rude thing , I shall \n",
      "take Emma 's advice and go out for a quarter \n",
      "of an hour . As the sun is out , \n",
      "I believe I had better take my three turns while \n",
      "I can . I treat you without ceremony , Mr. \n",
      "Knightley . We invalids think we are privileged people . \n",
      "'' `` My dear sir , do not make a \n",
      "stranger of me . '' `` I leave an excellent \n",
      "substitute in my daughter . Emma will be happy to \n",
      "entertain you . And therefore I think I will beg \n",
      "your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter \n",
      "walk . '' `` You can not do better , \n",
      "sir . '' `` I would ask for the pleasure \n",
      "of your company , Mr. Knightley , but I am \n",
      "a very slow walker , and my pace would be \n",
      "tedious to you ; and , besides , you have \n",
      "another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey . \n",
      "'' `` Thank you , sir , thank you ; \n",
      "I am going this moment myself ; and I think \n",
      "the sooner _you_ go the better . I will fetch \n",
      "your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . \n",
      "'' Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat \n",
      "down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He \n",
      "began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with \n",
      "more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before . \n",
      "`` I can not rate her beauty as you do \n",
      ", '' said he ; `` but she is a \n",
      "pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think \n",
      "very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon \n",
      "those she is with ; but in good hands she \n",
      "will turn out a valuable woman . '' `` I \n",
      "am glad you think so ; and the good hands \n",
      ", I hope , may not be wanting . '' \n",
      "`` Come , '' said he , `` you are \n",
      "anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you \n",
      "that you have improved her . You have cured her \n",
      "of her school-girl 's giggle ; she really does you \n",
      "credit . '' `` Thank you . I should be \n",
      "mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been \n",
      "of some use ; but it is not every body \n",
      "who will bestow praise where they may . _You_ do \n",
      "not often overpower me with it . '' `` You \n",
      "are expecting her again , you say , this morning \n",
      "? '' `` Almost every moment . She has been \n",
      "gone longer already than she intended . '' `` Something \n",
      "has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps . \n",
      "'' `` Highbury gossips ! -- Tiresome wretches ! '' \n",
      "`` Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you \n",
      "would . '' Emma knew this was too true for \n",
      "contradiction , and therefore said nothing . He presently added \n",
      ", with a smile , '' I do not pretend \n",
      "to fix on times or places , but I must \n",
      "tell you that I have good reason to believe your \n",
      "little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage \n",
      ". '' `` Indeed ! how so ? of what \n",
      "sort ? '' `` A very serious sort , I \n",
      "assure you ; '' still smiling . `` Very serious \n",
      "! I can think of but one thing -- Who \n",
      "is in love with her ? Who makes you their \n",
      "confidant ? '' Emma was more than half in hopes \n",
      "of Mr. Elton 's having dropt a hint . Mr. \n",
      "Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , \n",
      "and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him . \n",
      "`` I have reason to think , '' he replied \n",
      ", `` that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer \n",
      "of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter : \n",
      "-- Robert Martin is the man . Her visit to \n",
      "Abbey-Mill , this summer , seems to have done his \n",
      "business . He is desperately in love and means to \n",
      "marry her . '' `` He is very obliging , \n",
      "'' said Emma ; `` but is he sure that \n",
      "Harriet means to marry him ? '' `` Well , \n",
      "well , means to make her an offer then . \n",
      "Will that do ? He came to the Abbey two \n",
      "evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it \n",
      ". He knows I have a thorough regard for him \n",
      "and all his family , and , I believe , \n",
      "considers me as one of his best friends . He \n",
      "came to ask me whether I thought it would be \n",
      "imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I \n",
      "thought her too young : in short , whether I \n",
      "approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of \n",
      "her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much \n",
      "of her ) as in a line of society above \n",
      "him . I was very much pleased with all that \n",
      "he said . I never hear better sense from any \n",
      "one than Robert Martin . He always speaks to the \n",
      "purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging \n",
      ". He told me every thing ; his circumstances and \n",
      "plans , and what they all proposed doing in the \n",
      "event of his marriage . He is an excellent young \n",
      "man , both as son and brother . I had \n",
      "no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved \n",
      "to me that he could afford it ; and that \n",
      "being the case , I was convinced he could not \n",
      "do better . I praised the fair lady too , \n",
      "and altogether sent him away very happy . If he \n",
      "had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have \n",
      "thought highly of me then ; and , I dare \n",
      "say , left the house thinking me the best friend \n",
      "and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night \n",
      "before last . Now , as we may fairly suppose \n",
      ", he would not allow much time to pass before \n",
      "he spoke to the lady , and as he does \n",
      "not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not \n",
      "unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard 's to-day \n",
      "; and she may be detained by a visitor , \n",
      "without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch . '' \n",
      "`` Pray , Mr. Knightley , '' said Emma , \n",
      "who had been smiling to herself through a great part \n",
      "of this speech , `` how do you know that \n",
      "Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ? '' `` Certainly \n",

      ". Was not she the whole day with you ? \n",
      "'' `` Come , '' said she , `` I \n",

      "This was obliged to be repeated before it could be \n",

      "and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall \n",
      "indignation , and said , '' Then she is a \n",
      "greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is \n",

      "a woman to be ready for any body who asks \n",
      "her . '' `` Nonsense ! a man does not \n",

      "It is a pity that they were ever got over \n",

      "Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity \n",

      "known only as parlour-boarder at a common school . She \n",
      "is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of \n",
      "any information . She has been taught nothing useful , \n",

      "by no means fair . You are not just to \n",
      "Harriet 's claims . They would be estimated very differently \n",
      "by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may \n",
      "be the richest of the two , but he is \n",
      "undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society. -- The \n",

      "an imprudent match . He knows the value of a \n",
      "good income as well as any body . Elton may \n",
      "talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally . He \n",

      "of promoting it , by the sanction he had given \n",
      "; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had \n",

      "Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but \n",
      "there was more indistinctness in the causes of her 's \n",

      "so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that \n",
      "her opinions were right and her adversary 's wrong , \n",
      "as Mr. Knightley . He walked off in more complete \n",

      "so materially cast down , however , but that a \n",
      "little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate \n",

      "to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young \n",
      "man 's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning , and \n",
      "meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave \n",
      "alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after \n",

      ", and in very good spirits , and without having \n",
      "any such reason to give for her long absence , \n",
      "she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own \n",

      "think or say what he would , she had done \n",
      "nothing which woman 's friendship and woman 's feelings would \n",
      "not justify . He had frightened her a little about \n",
      "Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley \n",
      "could not have observed him as she had done , \n",
      "neither with the interest , nor ( she must be \n",
      "allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley \n",

      "on such a question as herself , that he had \n",

      ", inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might \n",
      "naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but \n",
      "then , Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for \n",
      "the influence of a strong passion at war with all \n",
      "interested motives . Mr. Knightley saw no such passion , \n",
      "and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but \n",
      "she saw too much of it to feel a doubt \n",
      "of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might \n",
      "originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming \n",
      "degree of prudence , she was very sure did not \n",
      "belong to Mr. Elton . Harriet 's cheerful look and \n",
      "manner established hers : she came back , not to \n",
      "think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. \n",
      "Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , \n",
      "which she repeated immediately with great delight . Mr. Perry \n",
      "had been to Mrs. Goddard 's to attend a sick \n",
      "child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and \n",
      "he had told Miss Nash , that as he was \n",
      "coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met \n",
      "Mr. Elton , and found to his great surprize , \n",

      "been never known to miss before ; and Mr. Perry \n",
      "had remonstrated with him about it , and told him \n",
      "how shabby it was in him , their best player \n",
      ", to absent himself , and tried very much to \n",
      "persuade him to put off his journey only one day \n",
      "; but it would not do ; Mr. Elton had \n",
      "been determined to go on , and had said in \n",
      "a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going \n",
      "on business which he would not put off for any \n",
      "inducement in the world ; and something about a very \n",
      "enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly \n",
      "precious . Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , \n",
      "but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ \n",
      "in the case , and he told him so ; \n",
      "and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , \n",
      "and rode off in great spirits . Miss Nash had \n",
      "told her all this , and had talked a great \n",
      "deal more about Mr. Elton ; and said , looking \n",
      "so very significantly at her , '' that she did \n",
      "not pretend to understand what his business might be , \n",
      "but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton \n",
      "could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in \n",
      "the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr. \n",
      "Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness . \n",
      "'' CHAPTER IX Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her , \n",
      "but Emma could not quarrel with herself . He was \n",
      "so much displeased , that it was longer than usual \n",
      "before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they \n",
      "did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was \n",
      "not forgiven . She was sorry , but could not \n",
      "repent . On the contrary , her plans and proceedings \n",
      "were more and more justified and endeared to her by \n",
      "the general appearances of the next few days . The \n",
      "Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon \n",
      "after Mr. Elton 's return , and being hung over \n",
      "the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room , he got up \n",
      "to look at it , and sighed out his half \n",
      "sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as \n",
      "for Harriet 's feelings , they were visibly forming themselves \n",
      "into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth \n",
      "and sort of mind admitted . Emma was soon perfectly \n",
      "satisfied of Mr. Martin 's being no otherwise remembered , \n",
      "than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , \n",
      "of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views \n",
      "of improving her little friend 's mind , by a \n",
      "great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never \n",
      "yet led to more than a few first chapters , \n",
      "and the intention of going on to-morrow . It was \n",
      "much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter \n",
      "to let her imagination range and work at Harriet 's \n",
      "fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension \n",
      "or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only \n",
      "literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only \n",
      "mental provision she was making for the evening of life \n",
      ", was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of \n",
      "every sort that she could meet with , into a \n",
      "thin quarto of hot-pressed paper , made up by her \n",
      "friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . In \n",
      "this age of literature , such collections on a very \n",
      "grand scale are not uncommon . Miss Nash , head-teacher \n",
      "at Mrs. Goddard 's , had written out at least \n",
      "three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the \n",
      "first hint of it from her , hoped , with \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse 's help , to get a great many \n",
      "more . Emma assisted with her invention , memory and \n",

      "true for contradiction . Unwelcome as it was , Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as \n",
      "Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his \n",
      "daughter 's attachment to her husband , she immediately led \n",
      "to such a branch of the subject as must raise \n",

      "are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was \n",
      "not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , \n",
      "which I thought very pretty of her . And he \n",
      "is a very clever boy , indeed . They are \n",
      "all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty \n",

      "`` He appears rough to you , '' said Emma \n",
      ", `` because you are so very gentle yourself ; \n",

      "boys to be active and hardy ; and if they \n",
      "misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and \n",
      "then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly \n",
      "Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father . The children \n",

      "their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to \n",
      "the ceiling in a very frightful way ! '' `` \n",
      "But they like it , papa ; there is nothing \n",
      "they like so much . It is such enjoyment to \n",
      "them , that if their uncle did not lay down \n",
      "the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would \n",
      "never give way to the other . '' `` Well \n",

      "is the case with us all , papa . One \n",
      "half of the world can not understand the pleasures of \n",
      "the other . '' Later in the morning , and \n",
      "just as the girls were going to separate in preparation \n",
      "for the regular four o'clock dinner , the hero of \n",
      "this inimitable charade walked in again . Harriet turned away \n",
      "; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile \n",
      ", and her quick eye soon discerned in his the \n",
      "consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown \n",
      "a die ; and she imagined he was come to \n",
      "see how it might turn up . His ostensible reason \n",
      ", however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse 's \n",
      "party could be made up in the evening without him \n",
      ", or whether he should be in the smallest degree \n",
      "necessary at Hartfield . If he were , every thing \n",
      "else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole \n",
      "had been saying so much about his dining with him \n",
      "-- had made such a point of it , that \n",
      "he had promised him conditionally to come . Emma thanked \n",
      "him , but could not allow of his disappointing his \n",
      "friend on their account ; her father was sure of \n",
      "his rubber . He re-urged -- she re-declined ; and \n",
      "he seemed then about to make his bow , when \n",
      "taking the paper from the table , she returned it \n",
      "-- '' Oh ! here is the charade you were \n",
      "so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you \n",
      "for the sight of it . We admired it so \n",
      "much , that I have ventured to write it into \n",
      "Miss Smith 's collection . Your friend will not take \n",
      "it amiss I hope . Of course I have not \n",
      "transcribed beyond the first eight lines . '' Mr. Elton \n",
      "certainly did not very well know what to say . \n",
      "He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something \n",
      "about '' honour , '' -- glanced at Emma and \n",
      "at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on \n",
      "the table , took it up , and examined it \n",
      "very attentively . With the view of passing off an \n",
      "awkward moment , Emma smilingly said , '' You must \n",
      "make my apologies to your friend ; but so good \n",
      "a charade must not be confined to one or two \n",
      ". He may be sure of every woman's approbation while \n",
      "he writes with such gallantry . '' `` I have \n",
      "no hesitation in saying , '' replied Mr. Elton , \n",
      "though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; `` \n",
      "I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if \n",
      "my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I \n",
      "have not the smallest doubt that , could he see \n",
      "his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( \n",
      "looking at the book again , and replacing it on \n",
      "the table ) , he would consider it as the \n",
      "proudest moment of his life . '' After this speech \n",
      "he was gone as soon as possible . Emma could \n",
      "not think it too soon ; for with all his \n",
      "good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of \n",
      "parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline \n",
      "her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the \n",
      "inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure \n",
      "to Harriet 's share . CHAPTER X Though now the \n",
      "middle of December , there had yet been no weather \n",
      "to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; \n",
      "and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit \n",
      "to pay to a poor sick family , who lived \n",
      "a little way out of Highbury . Their road to \n",
      "this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane \n",
      "leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular \n",
      ", main street of the place ; and , as \n",
      "may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr. \n",
      "Elton . A few inferior dwellings were first to be \n",
      "passed , and then , about a quarter of a \n",
      "mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old \n",
      "and not very good house , almost as close to \n",
      "the road as it could be . It had no \n",
      "advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened \n",
      "up by the present proprietor ; and , such as \n",
      "it was , there could be no possibility of the \n",
      "two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing \n",
      "eyes. -- Emma 's remark was -- '' There it \n",
      "is . There go you and your riddle-book one of \n",
      "these days . '' -- Harriet 's was -- '' \n",
      "Oh , what a sweet house ! -- How very \n",
      "beautiful ! -- There are the yellow curtains that Miss \n",
      "Nash admires so much . '' `` I do not \n",
      "often walk this way _now_ , '' said Emma , \n",
      "as they proceeded , '' but _then_ there will be \n",
      "an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted \n",
      "with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards \n",
      "of this part of Highbury . '' Harriet , she \n",
      "found , had never in her life been within side \n",
      "the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was \n",
      "so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , \n",
      "Emma could only class it , as a proof of \n",
      "love , with Mr. Elton 's seeing ready wit in \n",
      "her . `` I wish we could contrive it , \n",
      "'' said she ; `` but I can not think \n",
      "of any tolerable pretence for going in ; -- no \n",
      "servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper \n",
      "-- no message from my father . '' She pondered \n",
      ", but could think of nothing . After a mutual \n",
      "silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again -- \n",
      "'' I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that \n",
      "you should not be married , or going to be \n",
      "married ! so charming as you are ! '' -- \n",
      "Emma laughed , and replied , '' My being charming \n",
      ", Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me \n",
      "to marry ; I must find other people charming -- \n",
      "one other person at least . And I am not \n",
      "only , not going to be married , at present \n",
      ", but have very little intention of ever marrying at \n",
      "all . '' `` Ah ! -- so you say \n",
      "; but I can not believe it . '' `` \n",
      "I must see somebody very superior to any one I \n",
      "have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr. Elton \n",
      ", you know , ( recollecting herself , ) is \n",
      "out of the question : and I do _not_ wish \n",
      "to see any such person . I would rather not \n",
      "be tempted . I can not really change for the \n",
      "better . If I were to marry , I must \n",
      "expect to repent it . '' `` Dear me ! \n",
      "-- it is so odd to hear a woman talk \n",
      "so ! '' -- '' I have none of the \n",
      "usual inducements of women to marry . Were I to \n",
      "fall in love , indeed , it would be a \n",
      "different thing ! but I never have been in love \n",
      "; it is not my way , or my nature \n",
      "; and I do not think I ever shall . \n",
      "And , without love , I am sure I should \n",
      "be a fool to change such a situation as mine \n",
      ". Fortune I do not want ; employment I do \n",
      "not want ; consequence I do not want : I \n",
      "believe few married women are half as much mistress of \n",
      "their husband 's house as I am of Hartfield ; \n",
      "and never , never could I expect to be so \n",
      "truly beloved and important ; so always first and always \n",
      "right in any man 's eyes as I am in \n",
      "my father 's . '' `` But then , to \n",
      "be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates \n",
      "! '' `` That is as formidable an image as \n",
      "you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought \n",
      "I should ever be like Miss Bates ! so silly \n",
      "-- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- \n",
      "so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell \n",
      "every thing relative to every body about me , I \n",
      "would marry to-morrow . But between _us_ , I am \n",
      "convinced there never can be any likeness , except in \n",
      "being unmarried . '' `` But still , you will \n",
      "be an old maid ! and that 's so dreadful \n",
      "! '' `` Never mind , Harriet , I shall \n",
      "not be a poor old maid ; and it is \n",
      "poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public \n",
      "! A single woman , with a very narrow income \n",
      ", must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! \n",
      "the proper sport of boys and girls , but a \n",
      "single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable \n",
      ", and may be as sensible and pleasant as any \n",
      "body else . And the distinction is not quite so \n",
      "much against the candour and common sense of the world \n",
      "as appears at first ; for a very narrow income \n",
      "has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour \n",
      "the temper . Those who can barely live , and \n",
      "who live perforce in a very small , and generally \n",
      "very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and \n",
      "cross . This does not apply , however , to \n",
      "Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and \n",
      "too silly to suit me ; but , in general \n",
      ", she is very much to the taste of every \n",
      "body , though single and though poor . Poverty certainly \n",
      "has not contracted her mind : I really believe , \n",
      "if she had only a shilling in the world , \n",
      "she would be very likely to give away sixpence of \n",
      "it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that \n",
      "is a great charm . '' `` Dear me ! \n",
      "but what shall you do ? how shall you employ \n",
      "yourself when you grow old ? '' `` If I \n",
      "know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , \n",
      "busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; \n",
      "and I do not perceive why I should be more \n",
      "in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty \n",
      ". Woman 's usual occupations of hand and mind will \n",
      "be as open to me then as they are now \n",
      "; or with no important variation . If I draw \n",
      "less , I shall read more ; if I give \n",
      "up music , I shall take to carpet-work . And \n",
      "as for objects of interest , objects for the affections \n",
      ", which is in truth the great point of inferiority \n",
      ", the want of which is really the great evil \n",
      "to be avoided in _not_ marrying , I shall be \n",
      "very well off , with all the children of a \n",
      "sister I love so much , to care about . \n",
      "There will be enough of them , in all probability \n",
      ", to supply every sort of sensation that declining life \n",
      "can need . There will be enough for every hope \n",
      "and every fear ; and though my attachment to none \n",
      "can equal that of a parent , it suits my \n",
      "ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder \n",
      ". My nephews and nieces ! -- I shall often \n",
      "have a niece with me . '' `` Do you \n",
      "know Miss Bates 's niece ? That is , I \n",
      "know you must have seen her a hundred times -- \n",
      "but are you acquainted ? '' `` Oh ! yes \n",
      "; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she \n",
      "comes to Highbury . By the bye , _that_ is \n",
      "almost enough to put one out of conceit with a \n",
      "niece . Heaven forbid ! at least , that I \n",
      "should ever bore people half so much about all the \n",
      "Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax . \n",
      "One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax \n",
      ". Every letter from her is read forty times over \n",
      "; her compliments to all friends go round and round \n",
      "again ; and if she does but send her aunt \n",
      "the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair \n",
      "of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing \n",
      "else for a month . I wish Jane Fairfax very \n",
      "well ; but she tires me to death . '' \n",
      "They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle \n",
      "topics were superseded . Emma was very compassionate ; and \n",
      "the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief \n",
      "from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and \n",
      "her patience , as from her purse . She understood \n",
      "their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their \n",
      "temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from \n",
      "those for whom education had done so little ; entered \n",
      "into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave \n",
      "her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will . In \n",
      "the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together \n",
      "which she came to visit ; and after remaining there \n",
      "as long as she could give comfort or advice , \n",
      "she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the \n",
      "scene as made her say to Harriet , as they \n",
      "walked away , '' These are the sights , Harriet \n",
      ", to do one good . How trifling they make \n",
      "every thing else appear ! -- I feel now as \n",
      "if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures \n",
      "all the rest of the day ; and yet , \n",
      "who can say how soon it may all vanish from \n",
      "my mind ? '' `` Very true , '' said \n",
      "Harriet . `` Poor creatures ! one can think of \n",
      "nothing else . '' `` And really , I do \n",
      "not think the impression will soon be over , '' \n",
      "said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , \n",
      "and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path \n",
      "through the cottage garden , and brought them into the \n",
      "lane again . `` I do not think it will \n",
      ", '' stopping to look once more at all the \n",
      "outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still \n",
      "greater within . `` Oh ! dear , no , \n",
      "'' said her companion . They walked on . The \n",
      "lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend \n",
      "was passed , Mr. Elton was immediately in sight ; \n",
      "and so near as to give Emma time only to \n",
      "say farther , '' Ah ! Harriet , here comes \n",
      "a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts \n",
      ". Well , ( smiling , ) I hope it \n",
      "may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and \n",
      "relief to the sufferers , it has done all that \n",
      "is truly important . If we feel for the wretched \n",
      ", enough to do all we can for them , \n",
      "the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves \n",
      ". '' Harriet could just answer , `` Oh ! \n",
      "dear , yes , '' before the gentleman joined them \n",
      ". The wants and sufferings of the poor family , \n",
      "however , were the first subject on meeting . He \n",
      "had been going to call on them . His visit \n",
      "he would now defer ; but they had a very \n",
      "interesting parley about what could be done and should be \n",
      "done . Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them \n",
      ". `` To fall in with each other on such \n",
      "an errand as this , '' thought Emma ; '' \n",
      "to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring \n",
      "a great increase of love on each side . I \n",
      "should not wonder if it were to bring on the \n",
      "declaration . It must , if I were not here \n",
      ". I wish I were anywhere else . '' Anxious \n",
      "to separate herself from them as far as she could \n",
      ", she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath \n",
      ", a little raised on one side of the lane \n",
      ", leaving them together in the main road . But \n",
      "she had not been there two minutes when she found \n",
      "that Harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her \n",
      "up too , and that , in short , they \n",
      "would both be soon after her . This would not \n",
      "do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having \n",
      "some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot \n",
      ", and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath \n",
      ", begged them to have the goodness to walk on \n",
      ", and she would follow in half a minute . \n",
      "They did as they were desired ; and by the \n",
      "time she judged it reasonable to have done with her \n",
      "boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in \n",
      "her power , being overtaken by a child from the \n",
      "cottage , setting out , according to orders , with \n",
      "her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To \n",
      "walk by the side of this child , and talk \n",
      "to and question her , was the most natural thing \n",
      "in the world , or would have been the most \n",
      "natural , had she been acting just then without design \n",
      "; and by this means the others were still able \n",
      "to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for \n",
      "her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily \n",
      ": the child 's pace was quick , and theirs \n",
      "rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at \n",
      "it , from their being evidently in a conversation which \n",
      "interested them . Mr. Elton was speaking with animation , \n",
      "Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma \n",
      ", having sent the child on , was beginning to \n",
      "think how she might draw back a little more , \n",
      "when they both looked around , and she was obliged \n",
      "to join them . Mr. Elton was still talking , \n",
      "still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced \n",
      "some disappointment when she found that he was only giving \n",
      "his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at \n",
      "his friend Cole 's , and that she was come \n",
      "in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire \n",
      ", the butter , the cellery , the beet-root , \n",
      "and all the dessert . `` This would soon have \n",
      "led to something better , of course , '' was \n",
      "her consoling reflection ; `` any thing interests between those \n",
      "who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction \n",
      "to what is near the heart . If I could \n",
      "but have kept longer away ! '' They now walked \n",
      "on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage \n",
      "pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least \n",
      "getting Harriet into the house , made her again find \n",
      "something very much amiss about her boot , and fall \n",
      "behind to arrange it once more . She then broke \n",
      "the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into \n",
      "a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to \n",
      "stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to \n",
      "rights so as to be able to walk home in \n",
      "tolerable comfort . `` Part of my lace is gone \n",
      ", '' said she , `` and I do not \n",
      "know how I am to contrive . I really am \n",
      "a most troublesome companion to you both , but I \n",
      "hope I am not often so ill-equipped . Mr. Elton \n",
      ", I must beg leave to stop at your house \n",
      ", and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband \n",
      "or string , or any thing just to keep my \n",
      "boot on . '' Mr. Elton looked all happiness at \n",
      "this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and \n",
      "attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to \n",
      "make every thing appear to advantage . The room they \n",
      "were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , \n",
      "and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which \n",
      "it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open \n",
      ", and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to \n",
      "receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She \n",
      "was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found \n",
      "it ; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should \n",
      "close it . It was not closed , however , \n",
      "it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper \n",
      "in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable \n",
      "for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining \n",
      "room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but \n",
      "herself . It could be protracted no longer . She \n",
      "was then obliged to be finished , and make her \n",
      "appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of \n",
      "the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; \n",
      "and , for half a minute , Emma felt the \n",
      "glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not \n",
      "do ; he had not come to the point . \n",
      "He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he \n",
      "had told Harriet that he had seen them go by \n",
      ", and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries \n",
      "and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious . \n",
      "`` Cautious , very cautious , '' thought Emma ; \n",
      "`` he advances inch by inch , and will hazard \n",
      "nothing till he believes himself secure . '' Still , \n",
      "however , though every thing had not been accomplished by \n",
      "her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself \n",
      "that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment \n",
      "to both , and must be leading them forward to \n",
      "the great event . CHAPTER XI Mr. Elton must now \n",
      "be left to himself . It was no longer in \n",
      "Emma's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures \n",
      ". The coming of her sister 's family was so \n",
      "very near at hand , that first in anticipation , \n",
      "and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime \n",
      "object of interest ; and during the ten days of \n",
      "their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected \n",
      "-- she did not herself expect -- that any thing \n",
      "beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her \n",
      "to the lovers . They might advance rapidly if they \n",
      "would , however ; they must advance somehow or other \n",
      "whether they would or no . She hardly wished to \n",
      "have more leisure for them . There are people , \n",
      "who the more you do for them , the less \n",
      "they will do for themselves . Mr. and Mrs. John \n",
      "Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from \n",
      "Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the \n",
      "usual interest . Till this year , every long vacation \n",
      "since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell \n",
      "Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had \n",
      "been given to sea-bathing for the children , and it \n",
      "was therefore many months since they had been seen in \n",
      "a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen \n",
      "at all by Mr. Woodhouse , who could not be \n",
      "induced to get so far as London , even for \n",
      "poor Isabella 's sake ; and who consequently was now \n",
      "most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short \n",
      "visit . He thought much of the evils of the \n",
      "journey for her , and not a little of the \n",
      "fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to \n",
      "bring some of the party the last half of the \n",
      "way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen \n",
      "miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John \n",
      "Knightley , their five children , and a competent number \n",
      "of nursery-maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety . The \n",
      "bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many \n",
      "to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and \n",
      "variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and \n",
      "confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any \n",
      "other cause , nor have endured much longer even for \n",
      "this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings \n",
      "of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley \n",
      ", that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate \n",
      "enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having \n",
      "instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating \n",
      "and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they \n",
      "could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , \n",
      "the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance \n",
      "to him , either in themselves or in any restless \n",
      "attendance on them . Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty \n",
      ", elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners \n",
      ", and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt \n",
      "up in her family ; a devoted wife , a \n",
      "doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father \n",
      "and sister that , but for these higher ties , \n",
      "a warmer love might have seemed impossible . She could \n",
      "never see a fault in any of them . She \n",
      "was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness \n",
      "; and with this resemblance of her father , she \n",
      "inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in \n",
      "her own health , over-careful of that of her children \n",
      ", had many fears and many nerves , and was \n",
      "as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as \n",
      "her father could be of Mr. Perry . They were \n",
      "alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , \n",
      "and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance \n",
      ". Mr. John Knightley was a tall , gentleman-like , \n",
      "and very clever man ; rising in his profession , \n",
      "domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but \n",
      "with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; \n",
      "and capable of being sometimes out of humour . He \n",
      "was not an ill-tempered man , not so often unreasonably \n",
      "cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his \n",
      "temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed \n",
      ", with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly \n",
      "possible that any natural defects in it should not be \n",
      "increased . The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt \n",
      "his . He had all the clearness and quickness of \n",
      "mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act \n",
      "an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He \n",
      "was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law . \n",
      "Nothing wrong in him escaped her . She was quick \n",
      "in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella \n",
      "never felt herself . Perhaps she might have passed over \n",
      "more had his manners been flattering to Isabella 's sister \n",
      ", but they were only those of a calmly kind \n",
      "brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; \n",
      "but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made \n",
      "her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her \n",
      "eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of \n",
      "respectful forbearance towards her father . There he had not \n",
      "always the patience that could have been wished . Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse 's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to \n",
      "a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed . It \n",
      "did not often happen ; for Mr. John Knightley had \n",
      "really a great regard for his father-in-law , and generally \n",
      "a strong sense of what was due to him ; \n",
      "but it was too often for Emma 's charity , \n",
      "especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently \n",
      "to be endured , though the offence came not . \n",
      "The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none \n",
      "but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity \n",
      "so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied \n",
      "cordiality . They had not been long seated and composed \n",
      "when Mr. Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the \n",
      "head and a sigh , called his daughter's attention to \n",
      "the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there \n",
      "last . `` Ah , my dear , '' said \n",
      "he , `` poor Miss Taylor -- It is a \n",
      "grievous business . '' `` Oh yes , sir , \n",
      "'' cried she with ready sympathy , `` how you \n",
      "must miss her ! And dear Emma , too ! \n",
      "-- What a dreadful loss to you both ! -- \n",
      "I have been so grieved for you. -- I could \n",
      "not imagine how you could possibly do without her. -- \n",
      "It is a sad change indeed. -- But I hope \n",
      "she is pretty well , sir . '' `` Pretty \n",
      "well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well. \n",
      "-- I do not know but that the place agrees \n",
      "with her tolerably . '' Mr. John Knightley here asked \n",
      "Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air \n",
      "of Randalls . `` Oh ! no -- none in \n",
      "the least . I never saw Mrs. Weston better in \n",
      "my life -- never looking so well . Papa is \n",
      "only speaking his own regret . '' `` Very much \n",
      "to the honour of both , '' was the handsome \n",
      "reply . `` And do you see her , sir \n",
      ", tolerably often ? '' asked Isabella in the plaintive \n",
      "tone which just suited her father . Mr. Woodhouse hesitated. \n",
      "-- '' Not near so often , my dear , \n",
      "as I could wish . '' `` Oh ! papa \n",
      ", we have missed seeing them but one entire day \n",
      "since they married . Either in the morning or evening \n",
      "of every day , excepting one , have we seen \n",
      "either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston , and generally both \n",
      ", either at Randalls or here -- and as you \n",
      "may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here . They \n",
      "are very , very kind in their visits . Mr. \n",
      "Weston is really as kind as herself . Papa , \n",
      "if you speak in that melancholy way , you will \n",
      "be giving Isabella a false idea of us all . \n",
      "Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be \n",
      "missed , but every body ought also to be assured \n",
      "that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing \n",
      "her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated \n",
      "-- which is the exact truth . '' `` Just \n",
      "as it should be , '' said Mr. John Knightley \n",
      ", `` and just as I hoped it was from \n",
      "your letters . Her wish of shewing you attention could \n",
      "not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and \n",
      "social man makes it all easy . I have been \n",
      "always telling you , my love , that I had \n",
      "no idea of the change being so very material to \n",
      "Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma \n",
      "'s account , I hope you will be satisfied . \n",
      "'' `` Why , to be sure , '' said \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse -- '' yes , certainly -- I can \n",
      "not deny that Mrs. Weston , poor Mrs. Weston , \n",

      "-- she is always obliged to go away again . \n",
      "'' `` It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston \n",

      "poor Mr . Weston . '' `` I think , \n",
      "indeed , '' said John Knightley pleasantly , `` that \n",
      "Mr. Weston has some little claim . You and I \n",
      ", Emma , will venture to take the part of \n",
      "the poor husband . I , being a husband , \n",
      "and you not being a wife , the claims of \n",
      "the man may very likely strike us with equal force \n",
      ". As for Isabella , she has been married long \n",
      "enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. \n",
      "Westons aside as much as she can . '' `` \n",
      "Me , my love , '' cried his wife , \n",
      "hearing and understanding only in part. -- '' Are you \n",
      "talking about me ? -- I am sure nobody ought \n",

      "'' `` He has not been here yet , '' \n",

      "of pleasure . I remember it was written from Weymouth \n",

      "My dear Madam , ' but I forget how it \n",

      "man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he \n",
      "finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or \n",

      "a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a \n",
      "mind to take it up ; but she struggled , \n",
      "and let it pass . She would keep the peace \n",
      "if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable \n",
      "in the strong domestic habits , the all-sufficiency of home \n",
      "to himself , whence resulted her brother's disposition to look \n",
      "down on the common rate of social intercourse , and \n",
      "those to whom it was important. -- It had a \n",
      "high claim to forbearance . CHAPTER XII Mr. Knightley was \n",
      "to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse , who did not like that any one \n",
      "should share with him in Isabella 's first day . \n",
      "Emma 's sense of right however had decided it ; \n",

      "brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance \n",
      "of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself , \n",
      "in procuring him the proper invitation . She hoped they \n",
      "might now become friends again . She thought it was \n",
      "time to make up . Making-up indeed would not do \n",
      ". _She_ certainly had not been in the wrong , \n",
      "and _he_ would never own that he had . Concession \n",
      "must be out of the question ; but it was \n",
      "time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled \n",
      "; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration \n",
      "of friendship , that when he came into the room \n",
      "she had one of the children with her -- the \n",
      "youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old \n",
      ", who was now making her first visit to Hartfield \n",
      ", and very happy to be danced about in her \n",
      "aunt 's arms . It did assist ; for though \n",
      "he began with grave looks and short questions , he \n",
      "was soon led on to talk of them all in \n",
      "the usual way , and to take the child out \n",
      "of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity \n",
      ". Emma felt they were friends again ; and the \n",
      "conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then \n",
      "a little sauciness , she could not help saying , \n",
      "as he was admiring the baby , '' What a \n",
      "comfort it is , that we think alike about our \n",
      "nephews and nieces . As to men and women , \n",
      "our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard \n",
      "to these children , I observe we never disagree . \n",
      "'' `` If you were as much guided by nature \n",

      "`` To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise \n",
      "from my being in the wrong . '' `` Yes \n",
      ", '' said he , smiling -- '' and reason \n",
      "good . I was sixteen years old when you were \n",
      "born . '' `` A material difference then , '' \n",
      "she replied -- '' and no doubt you were much \n",
      "my superior in judgment at that period of our lives \n",
      "; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring \n",
      "our understandings a good deal nearer ? '' `` Yes \n",
      "-- a good deal _nearer_ . '' `` But still \n",
      ", not near enough to give me a chance of \n",
      "being right , if we think differently . '' `` \n",
      "I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years \n",
      "' experience , and by not being a pretty young \n",
      "woman and a spoiled child . Come , my dear \n",
      "Emma , let us be friends , and say no \n",
      "more about it . Tell your aunt , little Emma \n",
      ", that she ought to set you a better example \n",
      "than to be renewing old grievances , and that if \n",
      "she were not wrong before , she is now . \n",
      "'' `` That 's true , '' she cried -- \n",
      "'' very true . Little Emma , grow up a \n",
      "better woman than your aunt . Be infinitely cleverer and \n",
      "not half so conceited . Now , Mr. Knightley , \n",
      "a word or two more , and I have done \n",
      ". As far as good intentions went , we were \n",
      "_both_ right , and I must say that no effects \n",
      "on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong \n",
      ". I only want to know that Mr. Martin is \n",
      "not very , very bitterly disappointed . '' `` A \n",
      "man can not be more so , '' was his \n",
      "short , full answer . `` Ah ! -- Indeed \n",
      "I am very sorry. -- Come , shake hands with \n",
      "me . '' This had just taken place and with \n",
      "great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , \n",
      "and `` How d 'ye do , George ? '' \n",
      "and `` John , how are you ? '' succeeded \n",
      "in the true English style , burying under a calmness \n",
      "that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which \n",
      "would have led either of them , if requisite , \n",
      "to do every thing for the good of the other \n",
      ". The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk \n",
      "with his dear Isabella , and the little party made \n",
      "two natural divisions ; on one side he and his \n",
      "daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; \n",
      "their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- \n",
      "and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other \n",
      ". The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits \n",
      ", but principally of those of the elder , whose \n",
      "temper was by much the most communicative , and who \n",
      "was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , \n",
      "he had generally some point of law to consult John \n",
      "about , or , at least , some curious anecdote \n",
      "to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping \n",
      "in hand the home-farm at Donwell , he had to \n",
      "tell what every field was to bear next year , \n",
      "and to give all such local information as could not \n",
      "fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it \n",
      "had equally been the longest part of his life , \n",
      "and whose attachments were strong . The plan of a \n",
      "drain , the change of a fence , the felling \n",
      "of a tree , and the destination of every acre \n",
      "for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was \n",
      "entered into with as much equality of interest by John \n",
      ", as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if \n",
      "his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire \n",
      "about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness \n",
      ". While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful \n",
      "affection with his daughter . `` My poor dear Isabella \n",
      ", '' said he , fondly taking her hand , \n",
      "and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy \n",
      "labours for some one of her five children -- '' \n",
      "How long it is , how terribly long since you \n",
      "were here ! And how tired you must be after \n",
      "your journey ! You must go to bed early , \n",
      "my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to \n",
      "you before you go. -- You and I will have \n",
      "a nice basin of gruel together . My dear Emma \n",
      ", suppose we all have a little gruel . '' \n",
      "Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as \n",
      "she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as \n",
      "unpersuadable on that article as herself ; -- and two \n",
      "basins only were ordered . After a little more discourse \n",
      "in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its \n",
      "not being taken every evening by every body , he \n",
      "proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection \n",
      ", '' It was an awkward business , my dear \n",
      ", your spending the autumn at South End instead of \n",
      "coming here . I never had much opinion of the \n",
      "sea air . '' `` Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended \n",
      "it , sir -- or we should not have gone \n",
      ". He recommended it for all the children , but \n",
      "particularly for the weakness in little Bella 's throat , \n",
      "-- both sea air and bathing . '' `` Ah \n",
      "! my dear , but Perry had many doubts about \n",
      "the sea doing her any good ; and as to \n",
      "myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though \n",
      "perhaps I never told you so before , that the \n",
      "sea is very rarely of use to any body . \n",
      "I am sure it almost killed me once . '' \n",
      "`` Come , come , '' cried Emma , feeling \n",
      "this to be an unsafe subject , `` I must \n",
      "beg you not to talk of the sea . It \n",
      "makes me envious and miserable ; -- I who have \n",
      "never seen it ! South End is prohibited , if \n",
      "you please . My dear Isabella , I have not \n",
      "heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet ; \n",
      "and he never forgets you . '' `` Oh ! \n",
      "good Mr. Perry -- how is he , sir ? \n",
      "'' `` Why , pretty well ; but not quite \n",
      "well . Poor Perry is bilious , and he has \n",
      "not time to take care of himself -- he tells \n",
      "me he has not time to take care of himself \n",
      "-- which is very sad -- but he is always \n",
      "wanted all round the country . I suppose there is \n",
      "not a man in such practice anywhere . But then \n",
      "there is not so clever a man any where . \n",
      "'' `` And Mrs. Perry and the children , how \n",
      "are they ? do the children grow ? I have \n",
      "a great regard for Mr. Perry . I hope he \n",
      "will be calling soon . He will be so pleased \n",
      "to see my little ones . '' `` I hope \n",
      "he will be here to-morrow , for I have a \n",
      "question or two to ask him about myself of some \n",
      "consequence . And , my dear , whenever he comes \n",
      ", you had better let him look at little Bella \n",
      "'s throat . '' `` Oh ! my dear sir \n",
      ", her throat is so much better that I have \n",
      "hardly any uneasiness about it . Either bathing has been \n",
      "of the greatest service to her , or else it \n",
      "is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. \n",
      "Wingfield 's , which we have been applying at times \n",
      "ever since August . '' `` It is not very \n",
      "likely , my dear , that bathing should have been \n",
      "of use to her -- and if I had known \n",
      "you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken \n",
      "to -- '' You seem to me to have forgotten \n",
      "Mrs. and Miss Bates , '' said Emma , '' \n",
      "I have not heard one inquiry after them . '' \n",
      "`` Oh ! the good Bateses -- I am quite \n",
      "ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most \n",
      "of your letters . I hope they are quite well \n",
      ". Good old Mrs. Bates -- I will call upon \n",
      "her to-morrow , and take my children. -- They are \n",
      "always so pleased to see my children. -- And that \n",
      "excellent Miss Bates ! -- such thorough worthy people ! \n",
      "-- How are they , sir ? '' `` Why \n",
      ", pretty well , my dear , upon the whole \n",
      ". But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about \n",
      "a month ago . '' `` How sorry I am \n",
      "! But colds were never so prevalent as they have \n",
      "been this autumn . Mr. Wingfield told me that he \n",
      "has never known them more general or heavy -- except \n",
      "when it has been quite an influenza . '' `` \n",
      "That has been a good deal the case , my \n",
      "dear ; but not to the degree you mention . \n",
      "Perry says that colds have been very general , but \n",
      "not so heavy as he has very often known them \n",
      "in November . Perry does not call it altogether a \n",
      "sickly season . '' `` No , I do not \n",
      "know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except -- \n",
      "'' Ah ! my poor dear child , the truth \n",
      "is , that in London it is always a sickly \n",
      "season . Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can \n",
      "be . It is a dreadful thing to have you \n",
      "forced to live there ! so far off ! -- \n",
      "and the air so bad ! '' `` No , \n",
      "indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad \n",
      "air . Our part of London is very superior to \n",
      "most others ! -- You must not confound us with \n",
      "London in general , my dear sir . The neighbourhood \n",
      "of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the \n",
      "rest . We are so very airy ! I should \n",
      "be unwilling , I own , to live in any \n",
      "other part of the town ; -- there is hardly \n",
      "any other that I could be satisfied to have my \n",
      "children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy ! \n",
      "-- Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square \n",
      "decidedly the most favourable as to air . '' `` \n",
      "Ah ! my dear , it is not like Hartfield \n",
      ". You make the best of it -- but after \n",
      "you have been a week at Hartfield , you are \n",
      "all of you different creatures ; you do not look \n",
      "like the same . Now I can not say , \n",
      "that I think you are any of you looking well \n",
      "at present . '' `` I am sorry to hear \n",
      "you say so , sir ; but I assure you \n",
      ", excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I \n",
      "am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite \n",
      "well myself ; and if the children were rather pale \n",
      "before they went to bed , it was only because \n",
      "they were a little more tired than usual , from \n",
      "their journey and the happiness of coming . I hope \n",
      "you will think better of their looks to-morrow ; for \n",
      "I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me , that he \n",
      "did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether \n",
      ", in such good case . I trust , at \n",
      "least , that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking \n",
      "ill , '' turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards \n",
      "her husband . `` Middling , my dear ; I \n",
      "can not compliment you . I think Mr. John Knightley \n",
      "very far from looking well . '' `` What is \n",
      "the matter , sir ? -- Did you speak to \n",
      "me ? '' cried Mr. John Knightley , hearing his \n",
      "own name . `` I am sorry to find , \n",
      "my love , that my father does not think you \n",
      "looking well -- but I hope it is only from \n",
      "being a little fatigued . I could have wished , \n",
      "however , as you know , that you had seen \n",
      "Mr. Wingfield before you left home . '' `` My \n",
      "dear Isabella , '' -- exclaimed he hastily -- '' \n",
      "pray do not concern yourself about my looks . Be \n",
      "satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , \n",
      "and let me look as I chuse . '' `` \n",
      "I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your \n",
      "brother , '' cried Emma , `` about your friend \n",
      "Mr. Graham 's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland \n",
      ", to look after his new estate . What will \n",
      "it answer ? Will not the old prejudice be too \n",
      "strong ? '' And she talked in this way so \n",
      "long and successfully that , when forced to give her \n",
      "attention again to her father and sister , she had \n",
      "nothing worse to hear than Isabella 's kind inquiry after \n",
      "Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great \n",
      "favourite with her in general , she was at that \n",
      "moment very happy to assist in praising . `` That \n",
      "sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax ! '' said Mrs. John \n",
      "Knightley. -- '' It is so long since I have \n",
      "seen her , except now and then for a moment \n",
      "accidentally in town ! What happiness it must be to \n",
      "her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she \n",
      "comes to visit them ! I always regret excessively on \n",
      "dear Emma 's account that she can not be more \n",
      "at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , \n",
      "I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able \n",
      "to part with her at all . She would be \n",
      "such a delightful companion for Emma . '' Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "agreed to it all , but added , '' Our \n",
      "little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such \n",
      "another pretty kind of young person . You will like \n",
      "Harriet . Emma could not have a better companion than \n",
      "Harriet . '' `` I am most happy to hear \n",
      "it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be \n",
      "so very accomplished and superior ! -- and exactly Emma \n",
      "'s age . '' This topic was discussed very happily \n",
      ", and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed \n",
      "away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not \n",
      "close without a little return of agitation . The gruel \n",
      "came and supplied a great deal to be said -- \n",
      "much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its \n",
      "wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon \n",
      "the many houses where it was never met with tolerable \n",
      "; -- but , unfortunately , among the failures which \n",
      "the daughter had to instance , the most recent , \n",
      "and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook \n",
      "at South End , a young woman hired for the \n",
      "time , who never had been able to understand what \n",
      "she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , \n",
      "thin , but not too thin . Often as she \n",
      "had wished for and ordered it , she had never \n",
      "been able to get any thing tolerable . Here was \n",
      "a dangerous opening . `` Ah ! '' said Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on \n",
      "her with tender concern. -- The ejaculation in Emma 's \n",
      "ear expressed , '' Ah ! there is no end \n",
      "of the sad consequences of your going to South End \n",
      ". It does not bear talking of . '' And \n",
      "for a little while she hoped he would not talk \n",
      "of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice \n",
      "to restore him to the relish of his own smooth \n",
      "gruel . After an interval of some minutes , however \n",
      ", he began with , '' I shall always be \n",
      "very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn \n",
      ", instead of coming here . '' `` But why \n",
      "should you be sorry , sir ? -- I assure \n",
      "you , it did the children a great deal of \n",
      "good . '' `` And , moreover , if you \n",
      "must go to the sea , it had better not \n",
      "have been to South End . South End is an \n",
      "unhealthy place . Perry was surprized to hear you had \n",
      "fixed upon South End . '' `` I know there \n",
      "is such an idea with many people , but indeed \n",
      "it is quite a mistake , sir. -- We all \n",
      "had our health perfectly well there , never found the \n",
      "least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr. Wingfield says \n",
      "it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy \n",
      "; and I am sure he may be depended on \n",
      ", for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air \n",
      ", and his own brother and family have been there \n",
      "repeatedly . '' `` You should have gone to Cromer \n",
      ", my dear , if you went anywhere. -- Perry \n",
      "was a week at Cromer once , and he holds \n",
      "it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places \n",
      ". A fine open sea , he says , and \n",
      "very pure air . And , by what I understand \n",
      ", you might have had lodgings there quite away from \n",
      "the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- \n",
      "very comfortable . You should have consulted Perry . '' \n",
      "`` But , my dear sir , the difference of \n",
      "the journey ; -- only consider how great it would \n",
      "have been. -- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead \n",
      "of forty . '' `` Ah ! my dear , \n",
      "as Perry says , where health is at stake , \n",
      "nothing else should be considered ; and if one is \n",
      "to travel , there is not much to chuse between \n",
      "forty miles and an hundred. -- Better not move at \n",
      "all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty \n",
      "miles to get into a worse air . This is \n",
      "just what Perry said . It seemed to him a \n",
      "very ill-judged measure . '' Emma 's attempts to stop \n",
      "her father had been vain ; and when he had \n",
      "reached such a point as this , she could not \n",
      "wonder at her brother-in-law 's breaking out . `` Mr. \n",
      "Perry , '' said he , in a voice of \n",
      "very strong displeasure , '' would do as well to \n",
      "keep his opinion till it is asked for . Why \n",
      "does he make it any business of his , to \n",
      "wonder at what I do ? -- at my taking \n",
      "my family to one part of the coast or another \n",
      "? -- I may be allowed , I hope , \n",
      "the use of my judgment as well as Mr . \n",
      "Perry. -- I want his directions no more than his \n",
      "drugs . '' He paused -- and growing cooler in \n",
      "a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , \n",
      "'' If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey \n",
      "a wife and five children a distance of an hundred \n",
      "and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than \n",
      "a distance of forty , I should be as willing \n",
      "to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself \n",
      ". '' `` True , true , '' cried Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , with most ready interposition -- '' very true \n",
      ". That 's a consideration indeed. -- But John , \n",
      "as to what I was telling you of my idea \n",
      "of moving the path to Langham , of turning it \n",
      "more to the right that it may not cut through \n",
      "the home meadows , I can not conceive any difficulty \n",
      ". I should not attempt it , if it were \n",
      "to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people \n",
      ", but if you call to mind exactly the present \n",
      "line of the path . . . . The only \n",
      "way of proving it , however , will be to \n",
      "turn to our maps . I shall see you at \n",
      "the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope , and then we \n",
      "will look them over , and you shall give me \n",
      "your opinion . '' Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by \n",
      "such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom \n",
      "he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been \n",
      "attributing many of his own feelings and expressions ; -- \n",
      "but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the \n",
      "present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother \n",
      ", and better recollections of the other , prevented any \n",
      "renewal of it . CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be \n",
      "a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley \n",
      ", in this short visit to Hartfield , going about \n",
      "every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children \n",
      ", and talking over what she had done every evening \n",
      "with her father and sister . She had nothing to \n",
      "wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass \n",
      "so swiftly . It was a delightful visit ; -- \n",
      "perfect , in being much too short . In general \n",
      "their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings \n",
      "; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of \n",
      "the house too , there was no avoiding , though \n",
      "at Christmas . Mr. Weston would take no denial ; \n",
      "they must all dine at Randalls one day ; -- \n",
      "even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible \n",
      "thing in preference to a division of the party . \n",
      "How they were all to be conveyed , he would \n",
      "have made a difficulty if he could , but as \n",
      "his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually \n",
      "at Hartfield , he was not able to make more \n",
      "than a simple question on that head ; it hardly \n",
      "amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma \n",
      "long to convince him that they might in one of \n",
      "the carriages find room for Harriet also . Harriet , \n",
      "Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial \n",
      "set , were the only persons invited to meet them \n",
      "; -- the hours were to be early , as \n",
      "well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse 's habits \n",
      "and inclination being consulted in every thing . The evening \n",
      "before this great event ( for it was a very \n",
      "great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on \n",
      "the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet \n",
      "at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much \n",
      "indisposed with a cold , that , but for her \n",
      "own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , \n",
      "Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house \n",
      ". Emma called on her the next day , and \n",
      "found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . \n",
      "She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat \n",
      ": Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , \n",
      "Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was \n",
      "too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded \n",
      "her from this delightful engagement , though she could not \n",
      "speak of her loss without many tears . Emma sat \n",
      "with her as long as she could , to attend \n",
      "her in Mrs. Goddard's unavoidable absences , and raise her \n",
      "spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton 's would be \n",
      "depressed when he knew her state ; and left her \n",
      "at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of \n",
      "his having a most comfortless visit , and of their \n",
      "all missing her very much . She had not advanced \n",
      "many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she \n",
      "was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards \n",
      "it , and as they walked on slowly together in \n",
      "conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on \n",
      "the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to \n",
      "inquire , that he might carry some report of her \n",
      "to Hartfield -- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley \n",
      "returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his \n",
      "two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed \n",
      "all the benefit of a country run , and seemed \n",
      "to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and \n",
      "rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined \n",
      "company and proceeded together . Emma was just describing the \n",
      "nature of her friend 's complaint ; -- '' a \n",
      "throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of \n",
      "heat about her , a quick , low pulse , \n",
      "& c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. \n",
      "Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats , \n",
      "and had often alarmed her with them . '' Mr. \n",
      "Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he \n",
      "exclaimed , '' A sore-throat ! -- I hope not \n",
      "infectious . I hope not of a putrid infectious sort \n",
      ". Has Perry seen her ? Indeed you should take \n",
      "care of yourself as well as of your friend . \n",
      "Let me entreat you to run no risks . Why \n",
      "does not Perry see her ? '' Emma , who \n",
      "was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this \n",
      "excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard 's experience \n",
      "and care ; but as there must still remain a \n",
      "degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason \n",
      "away , which she would rather feed and assist than \n",
      "not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite \n",
      "another subject , '' It is so cold , so \n",
      "very cold -- and looks and feels so very much \n",
      "like snow , that if it were to any other \n",
      "place or with any other party , I should really \n",
      "try not to go out to-day -- and dissuade my \n",
      "father from venturing ; but as he has made up \n",
      "his mind , and does not seem to feel the \n",
      "cold himself , I do not like to interfere , \n",
      "as I know it would be so great a disappointment \n",
      "to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . But , upon my \n",
      "word , Mr. Elton , in your case , I \n",
      "should certainly excuse myself . You appear to me a \n",
      "little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand \n",
      "of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring , I \n",
      "think it would be no more than common prudence to \n",
      "stay at home and take care of yourself to-night . \n",
      "'' Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very \n",
      "well know what answer to make ; which was exactly \n",
      "the case ; for though very much gratified by the \n",
      "kind care of such a fair lady , and not \n",
      "liking to resist any advice of her 's , he \n",
      "had not really the least inclination to give up the \n",
      "visit ; -- but Emma , too eager and busy \n",
      "in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him \n",
      "impartially , or see him with clear vision , was \n",
      "very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being \n",
      "`` very cold , certainly very cold , '' and \n",
      "walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls \n",
      ", and secured him the power of sending to inquire \n",
      "after Harriet every hour of the evening . `` You \n",
      "do quite right , '' said she ; -- '' \n",
      "we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs . \n",
      "Weston . '' But hardly had she so spoken , \n",
      "when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat \n",
      "in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton's \n",
      "only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer \n",
      "with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing \n",
      "; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had \n",
      "his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this \n",
      "moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor \n",
      "his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at \n",
      "her . `` Well , '' said she to herself \n",
      ", `` this is most strange ! -- After I \n",
      "had got him off so well , to chuse to \n",
      "go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind ! \n",
      "-- Most strange indeed ! -- But there is , \n",
      "I believe , in many men , especially single men \n",
      ", such an inclination -- such a passion for dining \n",
      "out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the \n",
      "class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities \n",
      ", almost their duties , that any thing gives way \n",
      "to it -- and this must be the case with \n",
      "Mr. Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing \n",
      "young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with \n",
      "Harriet ; but still , he can not refuse an \n",
      "invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked \n",
      ". What a strange thing love is ! he can \n",
      "see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine \n",
      "alone for her . '' Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted \n",
      "them , and she could not but do him the \n",
      "justice of feeling that there was a great deal of \n",
      "sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; \n",
      "in the tone of his voice while assuring her that \n",
      "he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her \n",
      "fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for \n",
      "the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped \n",
      "to be able to give a better report ; and \n",
      "he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that \n",
      "left the balance of approbation much in his favour . \n",
      "After a few minutes of entire silence between them , \n",
      "John Knightley began with -- '' I never in my \n",
      "life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than \n",
      "Mr. Elton . It is downright labour to him where \n",
      "ladies are concerned . With men he can be rational \n",
      "and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please \n",
      ", every feature works . '' `` Mr. Elton 's \n",
      "manners are not perfect , '' replied Emma ; `` \n",
      "but where there is a wish to please , one \n",
      "ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great \n",
      "deal . Where a man does his best with only \n",
      "moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent \n",
      "superiority . There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in \n",
      "Mr. Elton as one can not but value . '' \n",
      "`` Yes , '' said Mr. John Knightley presently , \n",
      "with some slyness , '' he seems to have a \n",
      "great deal of good-will towards you . '' `` Me \n",
      "! '' she replied with a smile of astonishment , \n",
      "`` are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's \n",
      "object ? '' `` Such an imagination has crossed me \n",
      ", I own , Emma ; and if it never \n",
      "occurred to you before , you may as well take \n",
      "it into consideration now . '' `` Mr. Elton in \n",
      "love with me ! -- What an idea ! '' \n",
      "`` I do not say it is so ; but \n",
      "you will do well to consider whether it is so \n",
      "or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . \n",
      "I think your manners to him encouraging . I speak \n",
      "as a friend , Emma . You had better look \n",
      "about you , and ascertain what you do , and \n",
      "what you mean to do . '' `` I thank \n",
      "you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken \n",
      ". Mr. Elton and I are very good friends , \n",
      "and nothing more ; '' and she walked on , \n",
      "amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often \n",
      "arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the \n",
      "mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for \n",
      "ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with \n",
      "her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and \n",
      "in want of counsel . He said no more . \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to \n",
      "the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness \n",
      ", he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from \n",
      "it , and set forward at last most punctually with \n",
      "his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less \n",
      "apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others \n",
      "; too full of the wonder of his own going \n",
      ", and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls \n",
      "to see that it was cold , and too well \n",
      "wrapt up to feel it . The cold , however \n",
      ", was severe ; and by the time the second \n",
      "carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow \n",
      "were finding their way down , and the sky had \n",
      "the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only \n",
      "a milder air to produce a very white world in \n",
      "a very short time . Emma soon saw that her \n",
      "companion was not in the happiest humour . The preparing \n",
      "and the going abroad in such weather , with the \n",
      "sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , \n",
      "were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did \n",
      "not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in \n",
      "the visit that could be at all worth the purchase \n",
      "; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage \n",
      "was spent by him in expressing his discontent . `` \n",
      "A man , '' said he , `` must have \n",
      "a very good opinion of himself when he asks people \n",
      "to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a \n",
      "day as this , for the sake of coming to \n",
      "see him . He must think himself a most agreeable \n",
      "fellow ; I could not do such a thing . \n",
      "It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this \n",

      "be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people \n",
      "'s not staying comfortably at home when they can ! \n",
      "If we were obliged to go out such an evening \n",
      "as this , by any call of duty or business \n",
      ", what a hardship we should deem it ; -- \n",
      "and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing \n",
      "than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , \n",
      "in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells \n",
      "man , in every thing given to his view or \n",
      "his feelings , to stay at home himself , and \n",
      "keep all under shelter that he can ; -- here \n",
      "are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in \n",
      "another man 's house , with nothing to say or \n",
      "to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , \n",
      "and may not be said and heard again to-morrow . \n",
      "Going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse \n",
      "; -- four horses and four servants taken out for \n",
      "nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into \n",
      "colder rooms and worse company than they might have had \n",
      "at home . '' Emma did not find herself equal \n",
      "to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he \n",
      "was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the \n",
      "`` Very true , my love , '' which must \n",
      "have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but \n",
      "she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer \n",
      "at all . She could not be complying , she \n",
      "dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence \n",
      ". She allowed him to talk , and arranged the \n",
      "glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her \n",
      "lips . They arrived , the carriage turned , the \n",
      "step was let down , and Mr. Elton , spruce \n",
      ", black , and smiling , was with them instantly \n",
      ". Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject \n",
      ". Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he \n",
      "was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that \n",
      "she began to think he must have received a different \n",
      "account of Harriet from what had reached her . She \n",
      "had sent while dressing , and the answer had been \n",
      ", `` Much the same -- not better . '' \n",
      "`` _My_ report from Mrs. Goddard 's , '' said \n",

      "Oh ! no -- I am grieved to find -- \n",
      "I was on the point of telling you that when \n",
      "I called at Mrs. Goddard 's door , which I \n",
      "did the very last thing before I returned to dress \n",
      ", I was told that Miss Smith was not better \n",
      ", by no means better , rather worse . Very \n",
      "much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that \n",
      "she must be better after such a cordial as I \n",
      "knew had been given her in the morning . '' \n",
      "Emma smiled and answered -- '' My visit was of \n",
      "use to the nervous part of her complaint , I \n",
      "hope ; but not even I can charm away a \n",
      "sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed \n",

      "probably heard . '' `` Yes -- I imagined -- \n",

      "has been used to her in these complaints , and \n",
      "I hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more \n",
      "comfortable report . But it is impossible not to feel \n",
      "uneasiness . Such a sad loss to our party to-day \n",
      "! '' `` Dreadful ! -- Exactly so , indeed. \n",
      "-- She will be missed every moment . '' This \n",
      "was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was \n",
      "really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . \n",
      "Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute \n",
      "afterwards he began to speak of other things , and \n",
      "in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . \n",
      "`` What an excellent device , '' said he , \n",
      "`` the use of a sheepskin for carriages . How \n",
      "very comfortable they make it ; -- impossible to feel \n",
      "cold with such precautions . The contrivances of modern days \n",
      "indeed have rendered a gentleman 's carriage perfectly complete . \n",
      "One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , \n",
      "that not a breath of air can find its way \n",
      "unpermitted . Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . It \n",
      "is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage \n",
      "we know nothing of the matter. -- Ha ! snows \n",
      "a little I see . '' `` Yes , '' \n",
      "said John Knightley , `` and I think we shall \n",
      "have a good deal of it . '' `` Christmas \n",

      "; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it \n",
      "did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day 's \n",
      "party , which it might very possibly have done , \n",
      "for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been \n",
      "much snow on the ground ; but now it is \n",
      "of no consequence . This is quite the season indeed \n",
      "for friendly meetings . At Christmas every body invites their \n",
      "friends about them , and people think little of even \n",
      "the worst weather . I was snowed up at a \n",
      "friend 's house once for a week . Nothing could \n",
      "be pleasanter . I went for only one night , \n",
      "and could not get away till that very day se'nnight \n",
      ". '' Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did \n",
      "not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly \n",
      ", '' I can not wish to be snowed up \n",
      "a week at Randalls . '' At another time Emma \n",
      "might have been amused , but she was too much \n",

      ". Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a \n",
      "pleasant party . `` We are sure of excellent fires \n",

      "the greatest comfort . Charming people , Mr. and Mrs. \n",
      "Weston ; -- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise \n",
      ", and he is exactly what one values , so \n",
      "hospitable , and so fond of society ; -- it \n",
      "will be a small party , but where small parties \n",
      "are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of \n",
      "any . Mr. Weston 's dining-room does not accommodate more \n",
      "than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I \n",
      "would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by \n",
      "two than exceed by two . I think you will \n",
      "agree with me , ( turning with a soft air \n",
      "to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have \n",
      "your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being \n",
      "used to the large parties of London , may not \n",
      "quite enter into our feelings . '' `` I know \n",
      "nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- \n",
      "I never dine with any body . '' `` Indeed \n",
      "! ( in a tone of wonder and pity , \n",
      ") I had no idea that the law had been \n",
      "so great a slavery . Well , sir , the \n",
      "time must come when you will be paid for all \n",
      "this , when you will have little labour and great \n",
      "enjoyment . '' `` My first enjoyment , '' replied \n",
      "John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep-gate , \n",
      "`` will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again \n",
      ". '' CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary \n",
      "for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston 's \n",
      "drawing-room ; -- Mr. Elton must compose his joyous looks \n",
      ", and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour . Mr. \n",
      "Elton must smile less , and Mr. John Knightley more \n",
      ", to fit them for the place. -- Emma only \n",
      "might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just \n",
      "as happy as she was . To her it was \n",
      "real enjoyment to be with the Westons . Mr. Weston \n",
      "was a great favourite , and there was not a \n",
      "creature in the world to whom she spoke with such \n",
      "unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one \n",
      ", to whom she related with such conviction of being \n",
      "listened to and understood , of being always interesting and \n",
      "always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities \n",
      ", and pleasures of her father and herself . She \n",
      "could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston \n",
      "had not a lively concern ; and half an hour \n",
      "'s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which \n",
      "the daily happiness of private life depends , was one \n",
      "of the first gratifications of each . This was a \n",
      "pleasure which perhaps the whole day 's visit might not \n",
      "afford , which certainly did not belong to the present \n",
      "half-hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , \n",
      "her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful \n",
      "to Emma , and she determined to think as little \n",
      "as possible of Mr. Elton 's oddities , or of \n",
      "any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was \n",
      "enjoyable to the utmost . The misfortune of Harriet 's \n",
      "cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival \n",
      ". Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to \n",
      "give the history of it , besides all the history \n",
      "of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of \n",
      "Emma 's being to follow , and had indeed just \n",
      "got to the end of his satisfaction that James should \n",
      "come and see his daughter , when the others appeared \n",
      ", and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly \n",
      "engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to \n",
      "turn away and welcome her dear Emma . Emma 's \n",
      "project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her \n",
      "rather sorry to find , when they had all taken \n",
      "their places , that he was close to her . \n",
      "The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards \n",
      "Harriet , from her mind , while he not only \n",
      "sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his \n",
      "happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her \n",
      "upon every occasion . Instead of forgetting him , his \n",
      "behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal \n",
      "suggestion of `` Can it really be as my brother \n",
      "imagined ? can it be possible for this man to \n",
      "be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me \n",

      "delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin \n",
      "admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little \n",
      "knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover , and \n",
      "made it some effort with her to preserve her good \n",
      "manners . For her own sake she could not be \n",
      "rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope \n",
      "that all would yet turn out right , she was \n",
      "even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; \n",
      "especially as something was going on amongst the others , \n",
      "in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense \n",
      ", which she particularly wished to listen to . She \n",
      "heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some \n",
      "information about his son ; she heard the words `` \n",
      "my son , '' and `` Frank , '' and \n",
      "`` my son , '' repeated several times over ; \n",
      "and , from a few other half-syllables very much suspected \n",

      "her would have been awkward . Now , it so \n",
      "happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never \n",
      "marrying , there was something in the name , in \n",
      "the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested \n",
      "her . She had frequently thought -- especially since his \n",
      "father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she \n",
      "_were_ to marry , he was the very person to \n",
      "suit her in age , character and condition . He \n",

      "belong to her . She could not but suppose it \n",
      "to be a match that every body who knew them \n",
      "must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did \n",
      "think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; \n",
      "and though not meaning to be induced by him , \n",
      "or by any body else , to give up a \n",
      "situation which she believed more replete with good than any \n",
      "she could change it for , she had a great \n",
      "curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding \n",
      "him pleasant , of being liked by him to a \n",
      "certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the \n",
      "idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations \n",
      ". With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were \n",
      "dreadfully ill-timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing \n",
      "very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of \n",
      "thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly \n",
      "pass without bringing forward the same information again , or \n",
      "the substance of it , from the open-hearted Mr . \n",
      "Weston. -- So it proved ; -- for when happily \n",
      "released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston \n",
      ", at dinner , he made use of the very \n",
      "first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very \n",
      "first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say \n",
      "to her , '' We want only two more to \n",
      "be just the right number . I should like to \n",
      "see two more here , -- your pretty little friend \n",
      ", Miss Smith , and my son -- and then \n",
      "I should say we were quite complete . I believe \n",
      "you did not hear me telling the others in the \n",
      "drawing-room that we are expecting Frank . I had a \n",
      "letter from him this morning , and he will be \n",
      "with us within a fortnight . '' Emma spoke with \n",
      "a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented \n",
      "to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith \n",
      "making their party quite complete . `` He has been \n",
      "wanting to come to us , '' continued Mr. Weston \n",
      ", '' ever since September : every letter has been \n",
      "full of it ; but he can not command his \n",

      "be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are \n",
      "sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices \n",
      ". But now I have no doubt of seeing him \n",
      "here about the second week in January . '' `` \n",
      "What a very great pleasure it will be to you \n",
      "! and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted \n",
      "with him , that she must be almost as happy \n",
      "as yourself . '' `` Yes , she would be \n",
      ", but that she thinks there will be another put-off \n",
      ". She does not depend upon his coming so much \n",
      "as I do : but she does not know the \n",
      "parties so well as I do . The case , \n",
      "you see , is -- ( but this is quite \n",
      "between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of \n",
      "it in the other room . There are secrets in \n",
      "all families , you know ) -- The case is \n",
      ", that a party of friends are invited to pay \n",
      "a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank \n",
      "'s coming depends upon their being put off . If \n",
      "they are not put off , he can not stir \n",
      ". But I know they will , because it is \n",
      "a family that a certain lady , of some consequence \n",
      ", at Enscombe , has a particular dislike to : \n",
      "and though it is thought necessary to invite them once \n",
      "in two or three years , they always are put \n",
      "off when it comes to the point . I have \n",
      "not the smallest doubt of the issue . I am \n",
      "as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of \n",
      "January , as I am of being here myself : \n",
      "but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper \n",
      "end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself \n",
      ", and has been so little used to them at \n",
      "Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects \n",
      ", as I have been long in the practice of \n",
      "doing . '' `` I am sorry there should be \n",
      "any thing like doubt in the case , '' replied \n",
      "Emma ; `` but am disposed to side with you \n",
      ", Mr. Weston . If you think he will come \n",
      ", I shall think so too ; for you know \n",
      "Enscombe . '' `` Yes -- I have some right \n",
      "to that knowledge ; though I have never been at \n",
      "the place in my life. -- She is an odd \n",
      "woman ! -- But I never allow myself to speak \n",
      "ill of her , on Frank 's account ; for \n",
      "I do believe her to be very fond of him \n",
      ". I used to think she was not capable of \n",
      "being fond of any body , except herself : but \n",
      "she has always been kind to him ( in her \n",
      "way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and \n",
      "expecting every thing to be as she likes ) . \n",
      "And it is no small credit , in my opinion \n",
      ", to him , that he should excite such an \n",
      "affection ; for , though I would not say it \n",
      "to any body else , she has no more heart \n",
      "than a stone to people in general ; and the \n",
      "devil of a temper . '' Emma liked the subject \n",
      "so well , that she began upon it , to \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the \n",
      "drawing-room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that \n",
      "she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming. -- \n",
      "Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that \n",
      "she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing \n",
      "the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked \n",
      "of : `` for I can not depend upon his \n",
      "coming . I can not be so sanguine as Mr. \n",
      "Weston . I am very much afraid that it will \n",
      "all end in nothing . Mr. Weston , I dare \n",
      "say , has been telling you exactly how the matter \n",
      "stands ? '' `` Yes -- it seems to depend \n",
      "upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs. Churchill , which \n",
      "I imagine to be the most certain thing in the \n",
      "world . '' `` My Emma ! '' replied Mrs. \n",
      "Weston , smiling , `` what is the certainty of \n",
      "caprice ? '' Then turning to Isabella , who had \n",
      "not been attending before -- '' You must know , \n",
      "my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no \n",
      "means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in \n",
      "my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends \n",
      "entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in \n",
      "short , upon her temper . To you -- to \n",
      "my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth \n",
      ". Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a \n",
      "very odd-tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends \n",
      "upon her being willing to spare him . '' `` \n",
      "Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill \n",
      ", '' replied Isabella : `` and I am sure \n",
      "I never think of that poor young man without the \n",
      "greatest compassion . To be constantly living with an ill-tempered \n",
      "person , must be dreadful . It is what we \n",
      "happily have never known any thing of ; but it \n",
      "must be a life of misery . What a blessing \n",
      ", that she never had any children ! Poor little \n",
      "creatures , how unhappy she would have made them ! \n",
      "'' Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston \n",
      ". She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston \n",
      "would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve \n",
      "which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , \n",
      "she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any \n",
      "thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those \n",
      "views on the young man , of which her own \n",
      "imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . But \n",
      "at present there was nothing more to be said . \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room . \n",
      "To be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement \n",
      "that he could not endure . Neither wine nor conversation \n",
      "was any thing to him ; and gladly did he \n",
      "move to those with whom he was always comfortable . \n",
      "While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found \n",
      "an opportunity of saying , '' And so you do \n",
      "not consider this visit from your son as by any \n",
      "means certain . I am sorry for it . The \n",
      "introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; \n",
      "and the sooner it could be over , the better \n",
      ". '' `` Yes ; and every delay makes one \n",
      "more apprehensive of other delays . Even if this family \n",
      ", the Braithwaites , are put off , I am \n",
      "still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing \n",
      "us . I can not bear to imagine any reluctance \n",
      "on his side ; but I am sure there is \n",
      "a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him \n",
      "to themselves . There is jealousy . They are jealous \n",
      "even of his regard for his father . In short \n",
      ", I can feel no dependence on his coming , \n",
      "and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine . '' \n",
      "`` He ought to come , '' said Emma . \n",
      "`` If he could stay only a couple of days \n",
      ", he ought to come ; and one can hardly \n",
      "conceive a young man's not having it in his power \n",
      "to do as much as that . A young _woman_ \n",
      ", if she fall into bad hands , may be \n",
      "teazed , and kept at a distance from those she \n",
      "wants to be with ; but one can not comprehend \n",
      "a young _man_ 's being under such restraint , as \n",
      "not to be able to spend a week with his \n",
      "father , if he likes it . '' `` One \n",
      "ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways \n",
      "of the family , before one decides upon what he \n",
      "can do , '' replied Mrs. Weston . `` One \n",
      "ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in \n",
      "judging of the conduct of any one individual of any \n",
      "one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly \n",
      "must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is \n",
      "so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to \n",
      "her . '' `` But she is so fond of \n",
      "the nephew : he is so very great a favourite \n",
      ". Now , according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill \n",
      ", it would be most natural , that while she \n",
      "makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , \n",
      "to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises \n",
      "incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed \n",
      "by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at \n",
      "all . '' `` My dearest Emma , do not \n",
      "pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a \n",
      "bad one , or to lay down rules for it \n",
      ": you must let it go its own way . \n",
      "I have no doubt of his having , at times \n",
      ", considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible \n",
      "for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be . \n",
      "'' Emma listened , and then coolly said , `` \n",
      "I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes . \n",
      "'' `` He may have a great deal of influence \n",
      "on some points , '' continued Mrs. Weston , `` \n",
      "and on others , very little : and among those \n",
      ", on which she is beyond his reach , it \n",
      "is but too likely , may be this very circumstance \n",
      "of his coming away from them to visit us . \n",
      "'' CHAPTER XV Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his \n",
      "tea ; and when he had drank his tea he \n",
      "was quite ready to go home ; and it was \n",
      "as much as his three companions could do , to \n",
      "entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour \n",
      ", before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was \n",
      "chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations \n",
      "of any sort ; but at last the drawing-room party \n",
      "did receive an augmentation . Mr. Elton , in very \n",
      "good spirits , was one of the first to walk \n",
      "in . Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on \n",
      "a sofa . He joined them immediately , and , \n",
      "with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them . \n",
      "Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement \n",
      "afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill \n",
      ", was willing to forget his late improprieties , and \n",
      "be as well satisfied with him as before , and \n",
      "on his making Harriet his very first subject , was \n",
      "ready to listen with most friendly smiles . He professed \n",
      "himself extremely anxious about her fair friend -- her fair \n",
      ", lovely , amiable friend . `` Did she know \n",
      "? -- had she heard any thing about her , \n",
      "since their being at Randalls ? -- he felt much \n",
      "anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her \n",
      "complaint alarmed him considerably . '' And in this style \n",
      "he talked on for some time very properly , not \n",
      "much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake \n",
      "to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and \n",
      "Emma was quite in charity with him . But at \n",
      "last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all \n",
      "at once as if he were more afraid of its \n",
      "being a bad sore throat on her account , than \n",
      "on Harriet 's -- more anxious that she should escape \n",
      "the infection , than that there should be no infection \n",
      "in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to \n",
      "entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again , \n",
      "for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ \n",
      "not to venture into such hazard till he had seen \n",
      "Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she \n",
      "tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back \n",
      "into its proper course , there was no putting an \n",
      "end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was \n",
      "vexed . It did appear -- there was no concealing \n",
      "it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love \n",
      "with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , \n",
      "if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! and \n",
      "she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned \n",
      "to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , `` Would \n",
      "not she give him her support ? -- would not \n",
      "she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it \n",
      "were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection \n",
      "? He could not be satisfied without a promise -- \n",
      "would not she give him her influence in procuring it \n",
      "? '' `` So scrupulous for others , '' he \n",
      "continued , `` and yet so careless for herself ! \n",
      "She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at \n",
      "home to-day , and yet will not promise to avoid \n",
      "the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . \n",
      "Is this fair , Mrs . Weston ? -- Judge \n",
      "between us . Have not I some right to complain \n",
      "? I am sure of your kind support and aid \n",
      ". '' Emma saw Mrs. Weston 's surprize , and \n",
      "felt that it must be great , at an address \n",
      "which , in words and manner , was assuming to \n",
      "himself the right of first interest in her ; and \n",
      "as for herself , she was too much provoked and \n",
      "offended to have the power of directly saying any thing \n",
      "to the purpose . She could only give him a \n",
      "look ; but it was such a look as she \n",
      "thought must restore him to his senses , and then \n",
      "left the sofa , removing to a seat by her \n",
      "sister , and giving her all her attention . She \n",
      "had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the \n",
      "reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for \n",
      "Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining \n",
      "the weather , and opened on them all with the \n",
      "information of the ground being covered with snow , and \n",
      "of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting \n",
      "wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : \n",
      "'' This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter \n",
      "engagements , sir . Something new for your coachman and \n",
      "horses to be making their way through a storm of \n",
      "snow . '' Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation \n",
      "; but every body else had something to say ; \n",
      "every body was either surprized or not surprized , and \n",
      "had some question to ask , or some comfort to \n",
      "offer . Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer \n",
      "him and turn his attention from his son-in-law , who \n",
      "was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . `` I admired \n",
      "your resolution very much , sir , '' said he \n",
      ", `` in venturing out in such weather , for \n",
      "of course you saw there would be snow very soon \n",
      ". Every body must have seen the snow coming on \n",
      ". I admired your spirit ; and I dare say \n",
      "we shall get home very well . Another hour or \n",
      "two 's snow can hardly make the road impassable ; \n",
      "and we are two carriages ; if one is blown \n",
      "over in the bleak part of the common field there \n",
      "will be the other at hand . I dare say \n",
      "we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight . \n",
      "'' Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort \n",
      ", was confessing that he had known it to be \n",
      "snowing some time , but had not said a word \n",
      ", lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and \n",
      "be an excuse for his hurrying away . As to \n",
      "there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to \n",
      "fall to impede their return , that was a mere \n",
      "joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty \n",
      ". He wished the road might be impassable , that \n",
      "he might be able to keep them all at Randalls \n",
      "; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation \n",
      "might be found for every body , calling on his \n",
      "wife to agree with him , that with a little \n",
      "contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she \n",
      "hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of \n",
      "there being but two spare rooms in the house . \n",
      "`` What is to be done , my dear Emma \n",
      "? -- what is to be done ? '' was \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse 's first exclamation , and all that he \n",
      "could say for some time . To her he looked \n",
      "for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her \n",
      "representation of the excellence of the horses , and of \n",
      "James , and of their having so many friends about \n",
      "them , revived him a little . His eldest daughter \n",
      "'s alarm was equal to his own . The horror \n",
      "of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children \n",
      "were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; \n",
      "and fancying the road to be now just passable for \n",
      "adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no \n",
      "delay , she was eager to have it settled , \n",
      "that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , \n",
      "while she and her husband set forward instantly through all \n",
      "the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them \n",
      ". `` You had better order the carriage directly , \n",
      "my love , '' said she ; '' I dare \n",
      "say we shall be able to get along , if \n",
      "we set off directly ; and if we do come \n",
      "to any thing very bad , I can get out \n",
      "and walk . I am not at all afraid . \n",
      "I should not mind walking half the way . I \n",
      "could change my shoes , you know , the moment \n",
      "I got home ; and it is not the sort \n",
      "of thing that gives me cold . '' `` Indeed \n",
      "! '' replied he . `` Then , my dear \n",
      "Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing \n",
      "in the world , for in general every thing does \n",
      "give you cold . Walk home ! -- you are \n",
      "prettily shod for walking home , I dare say . \n",
      "It will be bad enough for the horses . '' \n",
      "Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the \n",
      "plan . Mrs. Weston could only approve . Isabella then \n",
      "went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely \n",
      "give up the hope of their being all able to \n",
      "get away ; and they were still discussing the point \n",
      ", when Mr. Knightley , who had left the room \n",
      "immediately after his brother 's first report of the snow \n",
      ", came back again , and told them that he \n",
      "had been out of doors to examine , and could \n",
      "answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their \n",
      "getting home , whenever they liked it , either now \n",
      "or an hour hence . He had gone beyond the \n",
      "sweep -- some way along the Highbury road -- the \n",
      "snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in \n",
      "many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a \n",
      "very few flakes were falling at present , but the \n",
      "clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of \n",
      "its being soon over . He had seen the coachmen \n",
      ", and they both agreed with him in there being \n",
      "nothing to apprehend . To Isabella , the relief of \n",
      "such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely \n",
      "less acceptable to Emma on her father 's account , \n",
      "who was immediately set as much at ease on the \n",
      "subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm \n",
      "that had been raised could not be appeased so as \n",
      "to admit of any comfort for him while he continued \n",
      "at Randalls . He was satisfied of there being no \n",
      "present danger in returning home , but no assurances could \n",
      "convince him that it was safe to stay ; and \n",
      "while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. \n",
      "Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences \n",
      ": thus -- '' Your father will not be easy \n",
      "; why do not you go ? '' `` I \n",
      "am ready , if the others are . '' `` \n",
      "Shall I ring the bell ? '' `` Yes , \n",
      "do . '' And the bell was rung , and \n",
      "the carriages spoken for . A few minutes more , \n",
      "and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in \n",
      "his own house , to get sober and cool , \n",
      "and the other recover his temper and happiness when this \n",
      "visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : \n",
      "and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such \n",
      "occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. \n",
      "Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either \n",
      "could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the \n",
      "sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and \n",
      "the discovery of a much darker night than he had \n",
      "been prepared for . `` He was afraid they should \n",
      "have a very bad drive . He was afraid poor \n",
      "Isabella would not like it . And there would be \n",
      "poor Emma in the carriage behind . He did not \n",
      "know what they had best do . They must keep \n",
      "as much together as they could ; '' and James \n",
      "was talked to , and given a charge to go \n",
      "very slow and wait for the other carriage . Isabella \n",
      "stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting \n",
      "that he did not belong to their party , stept \n",
      "in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma \n",
      "found , on being escorted and followed into the second \n",
      "carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to \n",
      "be lawfully shut on them , and that they were \n",
      "to have a tete-a-tete drive . It would not have \n",
      "been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have \n",
      "been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of \n",
      "this very day ; she could have talked to him \n",
      "of Harriet , and the three-quarters of a mile would \n",
      "have seemed but one . But now , she would \n",
      "rather it had not happened . She believed he had \n",
      "been drinking too much of Mr. Weston 's good wine \n",
      ", and felt sure that he would want to be \n",
      "talking nonsense . To restrain him as much as might \n",
      "be , by her own manners , she was immediately \n",
      "preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the \n",
      "weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun \n",
      ", scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the \n",
      "other carriage , than she found her subject cut up \n",
      "-- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and \n",
      "Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her : availing \n",
      "himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must \n",
      "be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring \n",
      "-- ready to die if she refused him ; but \n",
      "flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and \n",
      "unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , \n",
      "and in short , very much resolved on being seriously \n",
      "accepted as soon as possible . It really was so \n",
      ". Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent \n",
      "diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , \n",
      "was professing himself _her_ lover . She tried to stop \n",
      "him ; but vainly ; he would go on , \n",
      "and say it all . Angry as she was , \n",
      "the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain \n",
      "herself when she did speak . She felt that half \n",
      "this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope \n",
      "that it might belong only to the passing hour . \n",
      "Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the \n",
      "playful , which she hoped would best suit his half \n",
      "and half state , she replied , '' I am \n",
      "very much astonished , Mr. Elton . This to _me_ \n",
      "! you forget yourself -- you take me for my \n",
      "friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be \n",
      "happy to deliver ; but no more of this to \n",
      "_me_ , if you please . '' `` Miss Smith \n",
      "! -- message to Miss Smith ! -- What could \n",
      "she possibly mean ! '' -- And he repeated her \n",
      "words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence \n",
      "of amazement , that she could not help replying with \n",
      "quickness , '' Mr. Elton , this is the most \n",
      "extraordinary conduct ! and I can account for it only \n",
      "in one way ; you are not yourself , or \n",
      "you could not speak either to me , or of \n",
      "Harriet , in such a manner . Command yourself enough \n",
      "to say no more , and I will endeavour to \n",
      "forget it . '' But Mr. Elton had only drunk \n",
      "wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all \n",
      "to confuse his intellects . He perfectly knew his own \n",
      "meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as \n",
      "most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for \n",
      "Miss Smith as her friend , -- but acknowledging his \n",
      "wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all , \n",
      "-- he resumed the subject of his own passion , \n",
      "and was very urgent for a favourable answer . As \n",
      "she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more \n",
      "of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles \n",
      "for politeness , replied , '' It is impossible for \n",
      "me to doubt any longer . You have made yourself \n",
      "too clear . Mr. Elton , my astonishment is much \n",
      "beyond any thing I can express . After such behaviour \n",
      ", as I have witnessed during the last month , \n",
      "to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been \n",
      "in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing \n",
      "me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of \n",
      "character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible \n",
      "! Believe me , sir , I am far , \n",
      "very far , from gratified in being the object of \n",
      "such professions . '' `` Good Heaven ! '' cried \n",
      "Mr. Elton , `` what can be the meaning of \n",
      "this ? -- Miss Smith ! -- I never thought \n",
      "of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence \n",
      "-- never paid her any attentions , but as your \n",
      "friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive \n",
      ", but as your friend . If she has fancied \n",
      "otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and \n",
      "I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , \n",
      "Miss Smith , indeed ! -- Oh ! Miss Woodhouse \n",
      "! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse is near ! No , upon my honour , \n",
      "there is no unsteadiness of character . I have thought \n",
      "only of you . I protest against having paid the \n",
      "smallest attention to any one else . Every thing that \n",
      "I have said or done , for many weeks past \n",
      ", has been with the sole view of marking my \n",
      "adoration of yourself . You can not really , seriously \n",
      ", doubt it . No ! -- ( in an \n",
      "accent meant to be insinuating ) -- I am sure \n",
      "you have seen and understood me . '' It would \n",
      "be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing \n",
      "this -- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost \n",
      ". She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able \n",
      "to reply : and two moments of silence being ample \n",
      "encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind , he \n",
      "tried to take her hand again , as he joyously \n",
      "exclaimed -- '' Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to \n",
      "interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have \n",
      "long understood me . '' `` No , sir , \n",
      "'' cried Emma , `` it confesses no such thing \n",
      ". So far from having long understood you , I \n",
      "have been in a most complete error with respect to \n",
      "your views , till this moment . As to myself \n",
      ", I am very sorry that you should have been \n",
      "giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther \n",
      "from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet \n",
      "-- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it \n",
      "appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I \n",
      "have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had \n",
      "I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield \n",
      ", I should certainly have thought you judged ill in \n",
      "making your visits so frequent . Am I to believe \n",
      "that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to \n",
      "Miss Smith ? -- that you have never thought seriously \n",
      "of her ? '' `` Never , madam , '' \n",
      "cried he , affronted in his turn : `` never \n",
      ", I assure you . _I_ think seriously of Miss \n",
      "Smith ! -- Miss Smith is a very good sort \n",
      "of girl ; and I should be happy to see \n",
      "her respectably settled . I wish her extremely well : \n",
      "and , no doubt , there are men who might \n",
      "not object to -- Every body has their level : \n",
      "but as for myself , I am not , I \n",
      "think , quite so much at a loss . I \n",
      "need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , \n",
      "as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith ! -- \n",
      "No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been \n",
      "for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received -- \n",
      "'' '' Encouragement ! -- I give you encouragement ! \n",
      "-- Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing \n",
      "it . I have seen you only as the admirer \n",
      "of my friend . In no other light could you \n",
      "have been more to me than a common acquaintance . \n",
      "I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that \n",
      "the mistake ends where it does . Had the same \n",
      "behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into \n",
      "a misconception of your views ; not being aware , \n",
      "probably , any more than myself , of the very \n",
      "great inequality which you are so sensible of . But \n",
      ", as it is , the disappointment is single , \n",
      "and , I trust , will not be lasting . \n",
      "I have no thoughts of matrimony at present . '' \n",
      "He was too angry to say another word ; her \n",
      "manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this \n",
      "state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , \n",
      "they had to continue together a few minutes longer , \n",
      "for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to \n",
      "a foot-pace . If there had not been so much \n",
      "anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but \n",
      "their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags \n",
      "of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into \n",
      "Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found \n",
      "themselves , all at once , at the door of \n",
      "his house ; and he was out before another syllable \n",
      "passed. -- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him \n",
      "a good night . The compliment was just returned , \n",
      "coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of \n",
      "spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There \n",
      "she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by \n",
      "her father , who had been trembling for the dangers \n",
      "of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a \n",
      "corner which he could never bear to think of -- \n",
      "and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- \n",
      "no James ; and there it seemed as if her \n",
      "return only were wanted to make every thing go well \n",
      ": for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill-humour \n",
      ", was now all kindness and attention ; and so \n",
      "particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as \n",
      "to seem -- if not quite ready to join him \n",
      "in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its \n",
      "being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in \n",
      "peace and comfort to all their little party , except \n",
      "herself. -- But her mind had never been in such \n",
      "perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to \n",
      "appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating \n",
      "allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . CHAPTER XVI \n",
      "The hair was curled , and the maid sent away \n",
      ", and Emma sat down to think and be miserable. \n",
      "-- It was a wretched business indeed ! -- Such \n",
      "an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for \n",
      "! -- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome \n",
      "! -- Such a blow for Harriet ! -- that \n",
      "was the worst of all . Every part of it \n",
      "brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other \n",
      "; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , \n",
      "all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted \n",
      "to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- \n",
      "more disgraced by mis-judgment , than she actually was , \n",
      "could the effects of her blunders have been confined to \n",
      "herself . `` If I had not persuaded Harriet into \n",
      "liking the man , I could have borne any thing \n",
      ". He might have doubled his presumption to me -- \n",
      "but poor Harriet ! '' How she could have been \n",
      "so deceived ! -- He protested that he had never \n",
      "thought seriously of Harriet -- never ! She looked back \n",
      "as well as she could ; but it was all \n",
      "confusion . She had taken up the idea , she \n",
      "supposed , and made every thing bend to it . \n",
      "His manners , however , must have been unmarked , \n",
      "wavering , dubious , or she could not have been \n",
      "so misled . The picture ! -- How eager he \n",
      "had been about the picture ! -- and the charade \n",
      "! -- and an hundred other circumstances ; -- how \n",
      "clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet . To \n",
      "be sure , the charade , with its `` ready \n",
      "wit '' -- but then the `` soft eyes '' \n",
      "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a \n",
      "jumble without taste or truth . Who could have seen \n",
      "through such thick-headed nonsense ? Certainly she had often , \n",
      "especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily \n",
      "gallant ; but it had passed as his way , \n",
      "as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , \n",
      "of taste , as one proof among others that he \n",
      "had not always lived in the best society , that \n",
      "with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance \n",
      "was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day \n",
      ", she had never , for an instant , suspected \n",
      "it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her \n",
      "as Harriet 's friend . To Mr. John Knightley was \n",
      "she indebted for her first idea on the subject , \n",
      "for the first start of its possibility . There was \n",
      "no denying that those brothers had penetration . She remembered \n",
      "what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. \n",
      "Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction \n",
      "he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly \n",
      "; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge \n",
      "of his character had been there shewn than any she \n",
      "had reached herself . It was dreadfully mortifying ; but \n",
      "Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , \n",
      "the very reverse of what she had meant and believed \n",
      "him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full \n",
      "of his own claims , and little concerned about the \n",
      "feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of \n",
      "things , Mr. Elton 's wanting to pay his addresses \n",
      "to her had sunk him in her opinion . His \n",
      "professions and his proposals did him no service . She \n",
      "thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by \n",
      "his hopes . He wanted to marry well , and \n",
      "having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , \n",
      "pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly \n",
      "easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need \n",
      "be cared for . There had been no real affection \n",
      "either in his language or manners . Sighs and fine \n",
      "words had been given in abundance ; but she could \n",
      "hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any \n",
      "tone of voice , less allied with real love . \n",
      "She need not trouble herself to pity him . He \n",
      "only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand \n",
      "pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he \n",
      "had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody \n",
      "else with twenty , or with ten . But -- \n",
      "that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her \n",
      "as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , \n",
      "meaning ( in short ) , to marry him ! \n",
      "-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind \n",
      "! -- look down upon her friend , so well \n",
      "understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be \n",
      "so blind to what rose above , as to fancy \n",
      "himself shewing no presumption in addressing her ! -- It \n",
      "was most provoking . Perhaps it was not fair to \n",
      "expect him to feel how very much he was her \n",
      "inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind \n",
      ". The very want of such equality might prevent his \n",
      "perception of it ; but he must know that in \n",
      "fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He \n",
      "must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several \n",
      "generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very \n",
      "ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody . \n",
      "The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being \n",
      "but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate \n",
      ", to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; \n",
      "but their fortune , from other sources , was such \n",
      "as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself \n",
      ", in every other kind of consequence ; and the \n",
      "Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration \n",
      "of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not \n",
      "two years ago , to make his way as he \n",
      "could , without any alliances but in trade , or \n",
      "any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation \n",
      "and his civility. -- But he had fancied her in \n",
      "love with him ; that evidently must have been his \n",
      "dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming \n",
      "incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma \n",
      "was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that \n",
      "her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and \n",
      "obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as \n",
      "( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a \n",
      "man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton \n",
      ", in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If \n",
      "_she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little \n",
      "right to wonder that _he_ , with self-interest to blind \n",
      "him , should have mistaken hers . The first error \n",
      "and the worst lay at her door . It was \n",
      "foolish , it was wrong , to take so active \n",
      "a part in bringing any two people together . It \n",
      "was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making \n",
      "light of what ought to be serious , a trick \n",
      "of what ought to be simple . She was quite \n",
      "concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things \n",
      "no more . `` Here have I , '' said \n",
      "she , `` actually talked poor Harriet into being very \n",
      "much attached to this man . She might never have \n",
      "thought of him but for me ; and certainly never \n",
      "would have thought of him with hope , if I \n",
      "had not assured her of his attachment , for she \n",
      "is as modest and humble as I used to think \n",
      "him . Oh ! that I had been satisfied with \n",
      "persuading her not to accept young Martin . There I \n",
      "was quite right . That was well done of me \n",
      "; but there I should have stopped , and left \n",
      "the rest to time and chance . I was introducing \n",
      "her into good company , and giving her the opportunity \n",
      "of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not \n",
      "to have attempted more . But now , poor girl \n",
      ", her peace is cut up for some time . \n",
      "I have been but half a friend to her ; \n",
      "and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so \n",
      "very much , I am sure I have not an \n",
      "idea of any body else who would be at all \n",
      "desirable for her ; -- William Coxe -- Oh ! \n",
      "no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a \n",
      "pert young lawyer . '' She stopt to blush and \n",
      "laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a \n",
      "more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been \n",
      ", and might be , and must be . The \n",
      "distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and \n",
      "all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the \n",
      "awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or \n",
      "discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment \n",
      ", and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her \n",
      "in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she \n",
      "went to bed at last with nothing settled but the \n",
      "conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth \n",
      "and natural cheerfulness like Emma 's , though under temporary \n",
      "gloom at night , the return of day will hardly \n",
      "fail to bring return of spirits . The youth and \n",
      "cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of \n",
      "powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant \n",
      "enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be \n",
      "sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter \n",
      "hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed \n",
      "for comfort than she had gone to bed , more \n",
      "ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , \n",
      "and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . \n",
      "It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not \n",
      "be really in love with her , or so particularly \n",
      "amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- \n",
      "that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior \n",
      "sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive \n",
      "-- and that there could be no necessity for any \n",
      "body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals \n",
      ", and especially for her father 's being given a \n",
      "moment 's uneasiness about it . These were very cheering \n",
      "thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of \n",
      "snow on the ground did her further service , for \n",
      "any thing was welcome that might justify their all three \n",
      "being quite asunder at present . The weather was most \n",
      "favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could \n",
      "not go to church . Mr. Woodhouse would have been \n",
      "miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was \n",
      "therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most \n",
      "unsuitable ideas . The ground covered with snow , and \n",
      "the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw \n",
      ", which is of all others the most unfriendly for \n",
      "exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , \n",
      "and every evening setting in to freeze , she was \n",
      "for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse \n",
      "with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for \n",
      "her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; \n",
      "and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's \n",
      "absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine \n",
      "every body at home ; and though she hoped and \n",
      "believed him to be really taking comfort in some society \n",
      "or other , it was very pleasant to have her \n",
      "father so well satisfied with his being all alone in \n",
      "his own house , too wise to stir out ; \n",
      "and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom \n",
      "no weather could keep entirely from them , -- '' \n",
      "Ah ! Mr. Knightley , why do not you stay \n",
      "at home like poor Mr . Elton ? '' These \n",
      "days of confinement would have been , but for her \n",
      "private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly \n",
      "suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of \n",
      "great importance to his companions ; and he had , \n",
      "besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls \n",
      ", that his amiableness never failed him during the rest \n",
      "of his stay at Hartfield . He was always agreeable \n",
      "and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body . \n",
      "But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all \n",
      "the present comfort of delay , there was still such \n",
      "an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation \n",
      "with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to \n",
      "be ever perfectly at ease . CHAPTER XVII Mr. and \n",
      "Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . \n",
      "The weather soon improved enough for those to move who \n",
      "must move ; and Mr. Woodhouse having , as usual \n",
      ", tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with \n",
      "all her children , was obliged to see the whole \n",
      "party set off , and return to his lamentations over \n",
      "the destiny of poor Isabella ; -- which poor Isabella \n",
      ", passing her life with those she doated on , \n",
      "full of their merits , blind to their faults , \n",
      "and always innocently busy , might have been a model \n",
      "of right feminine happiness . The evening of the very \n",
      "day on which they went brought a note from Mr. \n",
      "Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , \n",
      "ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton 's \n",
      "best compliments , `` that he was proposing to leave \n",
      "Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; \n",
      "where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some \n",
      "friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks \n",
      ", and very much regretted the impossibility he was under \n",
      ", from various circumstances of weather and business , of \n",
      "taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose \n",
      "friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- \n",
      "and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy \n",
      "to attend to them . '' Emma was most agreeably \n",
      "surprized. -- Mr . Elton 's absence just at this \n",
      "time was the very thing to be desired . She \n",
      "admired him for contriving it , though not able to \n",
      "give him much credit for the manner in which it \n",
      "was announced . Resentment could not have been more plainly \n",
      "spoken than in a civility to her father , from \n",
      "which she was so pointedly excluded . She had not \n",
      "even a share in his opening compliments. -- Her name \n",
      "was not mentioned ; -- and there was so striking \n",
      "a change in all this , and such an ill-judged \n",
      "solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she \n",
      "thought , at first , could not escape her father \n",
      "'s suspicion . It did , however. -- Her father \n",
      "was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden \n",
      "a journey , and his fears that Mr. Elton might \n",
      "never get safely to the end of it , and \n",
      "saw nothing extraordinary in his language . It was a \n",
      "very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh \n",
      "matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their \n",
      "lonely evening . Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms , \n",
      "and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with \n",
      "all her usual promptitude . She now resolved to keep \n",
      "Harriet no longer in the dark . She had reason \n",
      "to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and \n",
      "it was desirable that she should have as much time \n",
      "as possible for getting the better of her other complaint \n",
      "before the gentleman 's return . She went to Mrs. \n",
      "Goddard 's accordingly the very next day , to undergo \n",
      "the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one \n",
      "it was. -- She had to destroy all the hopes \n",
      "which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear \n",
      "in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and \n",
      "acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas \n",
      "on one subject , all her observations , all her \n",
      "convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks \n",
      ". The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and \n",
      "the sight of Harriet 's tears made her think that \n",
      "she should never be in charity with herself again . \n",
      "Harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- \n",
      "and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition \n",
      "and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with \n",
      "particular advantage at that moment to her friend . Emma \n",
      "was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to \n",
      "the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all \n",
      "that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet 's \n",
      "side , not her own . Harriet did not consider \n",
      "herself as having any thing to complain of . The \n",
      "affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have \n",
      "been too great a distinction. -- She never could have \n",
      "deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind \n",
      "a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible \n",
      ". Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was \n",
      "so truly artless , that no dignity could have made \n",
      "it more respectable in Emma 's eyes -- and she \n",
      "listened to her and tried to console her with all \n",
      "her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced \n",
      "that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- \n",
      "and that to resemble her would be more for her \n",
      "own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence \n",
      "could do . It was rather too late in the \n",
      "day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant ; but \n",
      "she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being \n",
      "humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest \n",
      "of her life . Her second duty now , inferior \n",
      "only to her father 's claims , was to promote \n",
      "Harriet 's comfort , and endeavour to prove her own \n",
      "affection in some better method than by match-making . She \n",
      "got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most \n",
      "unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , \n",
      "and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton \n",
      "from her thoughts . Time , she knew , must \n",
      "be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she \n",
      "could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters \n",
      "in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an \n",
      "attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed \n",
      "to her reasonable that at Harriet 's age , and \n",
      "with the entire extinction of all hope , such a \n",
      "progress might be made towards a state of composure by \n",
      "the time of Mr. Elton 's return , as to \n",
      "allow them all to meet again in the common routine \n",
      "of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or \n",
      "increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , \n",
      "and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him \n",
      "in person or goodness -- and did , in truth \n",
      ", prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had \n",
      "foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural \n",
      ", so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that \n",
      "sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing \n",
      "very long in equal force . If Mr. Elton , \n",
      "on his return , made his own indifference as evident \n",
      "and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously \n",
      "do , she could not imagine Harriet 's persisting to \n",
      "place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of \n",
      "him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , \n",
      "in the same place , was bad for each , \n",
      "for all three . Not one of them had the \n",
      "power of removal , or of effecting any material change \n",
      "of society . They must encounter each other , and \n",
      "make the best of it . Harriet was farther unfortunate \n",
      "in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard 's \n",
      "; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers \n",
      "and great girls in the school ; and it must \n",
      "be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance \n",
      "of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent \n",
      "truth . Where the wound had been given , there \n",
      "must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma \n",
      "felt that , till she saw her in the way \n",
      "of cure , there could be no true peace for \n",
      "herself . CHAPTER XVIII Mr. Frank Churchill did not come \n",
      ". When the time proposed drew near , Mrs. Weston \n",
      "'s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter \n",
      "of excuse . For the present , he could not \n",
      "be spared , to his `` very great mortification and \n",
      "regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope \n",
      "of coming to Randalls at no distant period . '' \n",
      "Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , \n",
      "in fact , than her husband , though her dependence \n",
      "on seeing the young man had been so much more \n",
      "sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever \n",
      "expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay \n",
      "for its hopes by any proportionate depression . It soon \n",
      "flies over the present failure , and begins to hope \n",
      "again . For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized \n",
      "and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that \n",
      "Frank 's coming two or three months later would be \n",
      "a much better plan ; better time of year ; \n",
      "better weather ; and that he would be able , \n",
      "without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them \n",
      "than if he had come sooner . These feelings rapidly \n",
      "restored his comfort , while Mrs. Weston , of a \n",
      "more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of \n",
      "excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for \n",
      "what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great \n",
      "deal more herself . Emma was not at this time \n",
      "in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. \n",
      "Frank Churchill 's not coming , except as a disappointment \n",
      "at Randalls . The acquaintance at present had no charm \n",
      "for her . She wanted , rather , to be \n",
      "quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , \n",
      "as it was desirable that she should appear , in \n",
      "general , like her usual self , she took care \n",
      "to express as much interest in the circumstance , and \n",
      "enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's disappointment \n",
      ", as might naturally belong to their friendship . She \n",
      "was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; \n",
      "and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( \n",
      "or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more \n",
      ", ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in \n",
      "keeping him away . She then proceeded to say a \n",
      "good deal more than she felt , of the advantage \n",
      "of such an addition to their confined society in Surry \n",
      "; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the \n",
      "gala-day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him \n",
      "would have made ; and ending with reflections on the \n",
      "Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement \n",
      "with Mr. Knightley ; and , to her great amusement \n",
      ", perceived that she was taking the other side of \n",
      "the question from her real opinion , and making use \n",
      "of Mrs. Weston 's arguments against herself . `` The \n",
      "Churchills are very likely in fault , '' said Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , coolly ; `` but I dare say he \n",
      "might come if he would . '' `` I do \n",
      "not know why you should say so . He wishes \n",
      "exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will \n",
      "not spare him . '' `` I can not believe \n",
      "that he has not the power of coming , if \n",
      "he made a point of it . It is too \n",
      "unlikely , for me to believe it without proof . \n",
      "'' `` How odd you are ! What has Mr. \n",
      "Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such \n",
      "an unnatural creature ? '' `` I am not supposing \n",
      "him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that \n",
      "he may have learnt to be above his connexions , \n",
      "and to care very little for any thing but his \n",
      "own pleasure , from living with those who have always \n",
      "set him the example of it . It is a \n",
      "great deal more natural than one could wish , that \n",
      "a young man , brought up by those who are \n",
      "proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud \n",
      ", luxurious , and selfish too . If Frank Churchill \n",
      "had wanted to see his father , he would have \n",
      "contrived it between September and January . A man at \n",
      "his age -- what is he ? -- three or \n",
      "four-and-twenty -- can not be without the means of doing \n",
      "as much as that . It is impossible . '' \n",
      "`` That 's easily said , and easily felt by \n",
      "you , who have always been your own master . \n",
      "You are the worst judge in the world , Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . You do \n",
      "not know what it is to have tempers to manage \n",
      ". '' `` It is not to be conceived that \n",
      "a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty \n",
      "of mind or limb to that amount . He can \n",
      "not want money -- he can not want leisure . \n",
      "We know , on the contrary , that he has \n",
      "so much of both , that he is glad to \n",
      "get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the \n",
      "kingdom . We hear of him for ever at some \n",
      "watering-place or other . A little while ago , he \n",
      "was at Weymouth . This proves that he can leave \n",
      "the Churchills . '' `` Yes , sometimes he can \n",
      ". '' `` And those times are whenever he thinks \n",
      "it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation \n",
      "of pleasure . '' `` It is very unfair to \n",
      "judge of any body 's conduct , without an intimate \n",
      "knowledge of their situation . Nobody , who has not \n",
      "been in the interior of a family , can say \n",
      "what the difficulties of any individual of that family may \n",
      "be . We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , \n",
      "and with Mrs. Churchill 's temper , before we pretend \n",
      "to decide upon what her nephew can do . He \n",
      "may , at times , be able to do a \n",
      "great deal more than he can at others . '' \n",
      "`` There is one thing , Emma , which a \n",
      "man can always do , if he chuses , and \n",
      "that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and \n",
      "finessing , but by vigour and resolution . It is \n",
      "Frank Churchill 's duty to pay this attention to his \n",
      "father . He knows it to be so , by \n",
      "his promises and messages ; but if he wished to \n",
      "do it , it might be done . A man \n",
      "who felt rightly would say at once , simply and \n",
      "resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill -- ` Every sacrifice of \n",
      "mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make \n",
      "to your convenience ; but I must go and see \n",
      "my father immediately . I know he would be hurt \n",
      "by my failing in such a mark of respect to \n",
      "him on the present occasion . I shall , therefore \n",
      ", set off to-morrow . ' -- If he would \n",
      "say so to her at once , in the tone \n",
      "of decision becoming a man , there would be no \n",
      "opposition made to his going . '' `` No , \n",
      "'' said Emma , laughing ; `` but perhaps there \n",
      "might be some made to his coming back again . \n",

      "II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together \n",
      "one morning , and , in Emma 's opinion , \n",
      "had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day \n",
      ". She could not think that Harriet 's solace or \n",
      "her own sins required more ; and she was therefore \n",
      "industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ; \n",
      "-- but it burst out again when she thought she \n",
      "had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what \n",
      "the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no \n",
      "other answer than a very plaintive -- '' Mr. Elton \n",
      "is so good to the poor ! '' she found \n",
      "something else must be done . They were just approaching \n",
      "the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates . She \n",
      "determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers \n",
      ". There was always sufficient reason for such an attention \n",
      "; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on \n",
      ", and she knew she was considered by the very \n",
      "few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , \n",
      "as rather negligent in that respect , and as not \n",
      "contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty \n",
      "comforts . She had had many a hint from Mr. \n",
      "Knightley and some from her own heart , as to \n",
      "her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the \n",
      "persuasion of its being very disagreeable , -- a waste \n",
      "of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror \n",
      "of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate \n",
      "and third-rate of Highbury , who were calling on them \n",
      "for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them \n",
      ". But now she made the sudden resolution of not \n",
      "passing their door without going in -- observing , as \n",
      "she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well \n",
      "as she could calculate , they were just now quite \n",
      "safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax . The house \n",
      "belonged to people in business . Mrs. and Miss Bates \n",
      "occupied the drawing-room floor ; and there , in the \n",
      "very moderate-sized apartment , which was every thing to them \n",
      ", the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed \n",
      "; the quiet neat old lady , who with her \n",
      "knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even \n",
      "to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and \n",
      "her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to \n",
      "overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their \n",
      "visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse 's health , cheerful communications about her mother \n",
      "'s , and sweet-cake from the beaufet -- '' Mrs. \n",
      "Cole had just been there , just called in for \n",
      "ten minutes , and had been so good as to \n",
      "sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken \n",
      "a piece of cake and been so kind as to \n",
      "say she liked it very much ; and , therefore \n",
      ", she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do \n",
      "them the favour to eat a piece too . '' \n",
      "The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed \n",
      "by that of Mr. Elton . There was intimacy between \n",
      "them , and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton \n",
      "since his going away . Emma knew what was coming \n",
      "; they must have the letter over again , and \n",
      "settle how long he had been gone , and how \n",
      "much he was engaged in company , and what a \n",
      "favourite he was wherever he went , and how full \n",
      "the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been ; and \n",
      "she went through it very well , with all the \n",
      "interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , \n",
      "and always putting forward to prevent Harriet 's being obliged \n",
      "to say a word . This she had been prepared \n",
      "for when she entered the house ; but meant , \n",
      "having once talked him handsomely over , to be no \n",
      "farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander \n",
      "at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury \n",
      ", and their card-parties . She had not been prepared \n",
      "to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton ; but he \n",
      "was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped \n",
      "away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , \n",
      "to usher in a letter from her niece . `` \n",
      "Oh ! yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- \n",
      "certainly as to dancing -- Mrs. Cole was telling me \n",
      "that dancing at the rooms at Bath was -- Mrs. \n",
      "Cole was so kind as to sit some time with \n",
      "us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as \n",
      "she came in , she began inquiring after her , \n",
      "Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever \n",
      "she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know \n",
      "how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must \n",
      "say that Jane deserves it as much as any body \n",
      "can . And so she began inquiring after her directly \n",
      ", saying , ` I know you can not have \n",
      "heard from Jane lately , because it is not her \n",
      "time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said \n",
      ", ` But indeed we have , we had a \n",
      "letter this very morning , ' I do not know \n",
      "that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` \n",
      "Have you , upon your honour ? ' said she \n",
      "; ` well , that is quite unexpected . Do \n",
      "let me hear what she says . ' '' Emma \n",
      "'s politeness was at hand directly , to say , \n",
      "with smiling interest -- '' Have you heard from Miss \n",
      "Fairfax so lately ? I am extremely happy . I \n",
      "hope she is well ? '' `` Thank you . \n",
      "You are so kind ! '' replied the happily deceived \n",
      "aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter. -- '' \n",
      "Oh ! here it is . I was sure it \n",
      "could not be far off ; but I had put \n",
      "my huswife upon it , you see , without being \n",
      "aware , and so it was quite hid , but \n",
      "I had it in my hand so very lately that \n",
      "I was almost sure it must be on the table \n",
      ". I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and \n",
      "since she went away , I was reading it again \n",
      "to my mother , for it is such a pleasure \n",
      "to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she \n",
      "can never hear it often enough ; so I knew \n",
      "it could not be far off , and here it \n",
      "is , only just under my huswife -- and since \n",
      "you are so kind as to wish to hear what \n",
      "she says ; -- but , first of all , \n",
      "I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise \n",
      "for her writing so short a letter -- only two \n",
      "pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general \n",
      "she fills the whole paper and crosses half . My \n",
      "mother often wonders that I can make it out so \n",
      "well . She often says , when the letter is \n",
      "first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I \n",
      "think you will be put to it to make out \n",
      "all that checker-work ' -- do n't you , ma'am \n",
      "? -- And then I tell her , I am \n",
      "sure she would contrive to make it out herself , \n",
      "if she had nobody to do it for her -- \n",
      "every word of it -- I am sure she would \n",
      "pore over it till she had made out every word \n",
      ". And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes \n",
      "are not so good as they were , she can \n",
      "see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the \n",
      "help of spectacles . It is such a blessing ! \n",
      "My mother's are really very good indeed . Jane often \n",
      "says , when she is here , ` I am \n",
      "sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong \n",
      "eyes to see as you do -- and so much \n",
      "fine work as you have done too ! -- I \n",
      "only wish my eyes may last me as well . \n",
      "' '' All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates \n",
      "to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very \n",
      "civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax 's handwriting . \n",
      "`` You are extremely kind , '' replied Miss Bates \n",
      ", highly gratified ; '' you who are such a \n",
      "judge , and write so beautifully yourself . I am \n",
      "sure there is nobody 's praise that could give us \n",
      "so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse 's . My mother \n",
      "does not hear ; she is a little deaf you \n",

      "was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates's \n",
      "youngest daughter . The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of \n",
      "the _______ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates \n",
      ", had had its day of fame and pleasure , \n",
      "hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it \n",
      ", save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action \n",
      "abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief \n",
      "soon afterwards -- and this girl . By birth she \n",
      "belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old \n",
      ", on losing her mother , she became the property \n",
      ", the charge , the consolation , the fondling of \n",
      "her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability \n",
      "of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being \n",
      "taught only what very limited means could command , and \n",
      "growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , \n",
      "to be engrafted on what nature had given her in \n",
      "a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm-hearted , \n",
      "well-meaning relations . But the compassionate feelings of a friend \n",
      "of her father gave a change to her destiny . \n",
      "This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded \n",
      "Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young \n",
      "man ; and farther , had been indebted to him \n",
      "for such attentions , during a severe camp-fever , as \n",
      "he believed had saved his life . These were claims \n",
      "which he did not learn to overlook , though some \n",
      "years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , \n",
      "before his own return to England put any thing in \n",
      "his power . When he did return , he sought \n",
      "out the child and took notice of her . He \n",
      "was a married man , with only one living child \n",
      ", a girl , about Jane 's age : and \n",
      "Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and \n",
      "growing a favourite with all ; and before she was \n",
      "nine years old , his daughter 's great fondness for \n",
      "her , and his own wish of being a real \n",
      "friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell \n",
      "of undertaking the whole charge of her education . It \n",
      "was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged \n",
      "to Colonel Campbell 's family , and had lived with \n",
      "them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to \n",
      "time . The plan was that she should be brought \n",
      "up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds \n",
      "which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . \n",
      "To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell \n",
      "'s power ; for though his income , by pay \n",
      "and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate \n",
      "and must be all his daughter 's ; but , \n",
      "by giving her an education , he hoped to be \n",
      "supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was \n",
      "Jane Fairfax 's history . She had fallen into good \n",
      "hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , \n",
      "and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with \n",
      "right-minded and well-informed people , her heart and understanding had \n",
      "received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel \n",
      "Campbell's residence being in London , every lighter talent had \n",
      "been done full justice to , by the attendance of \n",
      "first-rate masters . Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy \n",
      "of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen \n",
      "or nineteen she was , as far as such an \n",
      "early age can be qualified for the care of children \n",
      ", fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; \n",
      "but she was too much beloved to be parted with \n",
      ". Neither father nor mother could promote , and the \n",
      "daughter could not endure it . The evil day was \n",
      "put off . It was easy to decide that she \n",
      "was still too young ; and Jane remained with them \n",
      ", sharing , as another daughter , in all the \n",
      "rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious \n",
      "mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback \n",
      "of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own \n",
      "good understanding to remind her that all this might soon \n",
      "be over . The affection of the whole family , \n",
      "the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was \n",
      "the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of \n",
      "Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . \n",
      "That nature had given it in feature could not be \n",
      "unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher \n",
      "powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They \n",
      "continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage \n",
      "of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that \n",
      "luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , \n",
      "giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what \n",
      "is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , \n",
      "a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as \n",
      "soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and \n",
      "happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread \n",
      "to earn . This event had very lately taken place \n",
      "; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted \n",
      "by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path \n",
      "of duty ; though she had now reached the age \n",
      "which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . \n",
      "She had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period \n",
      ". With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she \n",
      "had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice , and \n",
      "retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational \n",
      "intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to \n",
      "penance and mortification for ever . The good sense of \n",
      "Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution \n",
      ", though their feelings did . As long as they \n",
      "lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home \n",
      "might be hers for ever ; and for their own \n",
      "comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this \n",
      "would be selfishness : -- what must be at last \n",
      ", had better be soon . Perhaps they began to \n",
      "feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have \n",
      "resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her \n",
      "from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure \n",
      "as must now be relinquished . Still , however , \n",
      "affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for \n",
      "not hurrying on the wretched moment . She had never \n",
      "been quite well since the time of their daughter 's \n",
      "marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her \n",
      "usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties \n",
      ", which , so far from being compatible with a \n",
      "weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the \n",
      "most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human \n",
      "perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable \n",
      "comfort . With regard to her not accompanying them to \n",
      "Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but \n",
      "truth , though there might be some truths not told \n",
      ". It was her own choice to give the time \n",
      "of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps \n",
      ", her last months of perfect liberty with those kind \n",
      "relations to whom she was so very dear : and \n",
      "the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives \n",
      ", whether single , or double , or treble , \n",
      "gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , \n",
      "that they depended more on a few months spent in \n",
      "her native air , for the recovery of her health \n",
      ", than on any thing else . Certain it was \n",
      "that she was to come ; and that Highbury , \n",
      "instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so \n",
      "long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put \n",
      "up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could \n",
      "bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence \n",
      ". Emma was sorry ; -- to have to pay \n",
      "civilities to a person she did not like through three \n",
      "long months ! -- to be always doing more than \n",
      "she wished , and less than she ought ! Why \n",
      "she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult \n",
      "question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her \n",
      "it was because she saw in her the really accomplished \n",
      "young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself \n",
      "; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at \n",
      "the time , there were moments of self-examination in which \n",
      "her conscience could not quite acquit her . But `` \n",
      "she could never get acquainted with her : she did \n",
      "not know how it was , but there was such \n",
      "coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased \n",
      "or not -- and then , her aunt was such \n",
      "an eternal talker ! -- and she was made such \n",
      "a fuss with by every body ! -- and it \n",
      "had been always imagined that they were to be so \n",
      "intimate -- because their ages were the same , every \n",
      "body had supposed they must be so fond of each \n",
      "other . '' These were her reasons -- she had \n",
      "no better . It was a dislike so little just \n",
      "-- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , \n",
      "that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after \n",
      "any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured \n",
      "her ; and now , when the due visit was \n",
      "paid , on her arrival , after a two years' \n",
      "interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance \n",
      "and manners , which for those two whole years she \n",
      "had been depreciating . Jane Fairfax was very elegant , \n",
      "remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value \n",
      "for elegance . Her height was pretty , just such \n",
      "as almost every body would think tall , and nobody \n",
      "could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; \n",
      "her size a most becoming medium , between fat and \n",
      "thin , though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to \n",
      "point out the likeliest evil of the two . Emma \n",
      "could not but feel all this ; and then , \n",
      "her face -- her features -- there was more beauty \n",
      "in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was \n",
      "not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . \n",
      "Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye-lashes \n",
      "and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; \n",
      "but the skin , which she had been used to \n",
      "cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness \n",
      "and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . It \n",
      "was a style of beauty , of which elegance was \n",
      "the reigning character , and as such , she must \n",
      ", in honour , by all her principles , admire \n",
      "it : -- elegance , which , whether of person \n",
      "or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury \n",
      ". There , not to be vulgar , was distinction \n",
      ", and merit . In short , she sat , \n",
      "during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with \n",
      "twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense \n",
      "of rendering justice , and was determining that she would \n",
      "dislike her no longer . When she took in her \n",
      "history , indeed , her situation , as well as \n",
      "her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance \n",
      "was destined to , what she was going to sink \n",
      "from , how she was going to live , it \n",
      "seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect \n",
      "; especially , if to every well-known particular entitling her \n",
      "to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of \n",
      "an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so \n",
      "naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing \n",
      "could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices \n",
      "she had resolved on . Emma was very willing now \n",
      "to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon 's actions \n",
      "from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which \n",
      "her imagination had suggested at first . If it were \n",
      "love , it might be simple , single , successless \n",
      "love on her side alone . She might have been \n",
      "unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer \n",
      "of his conversation with her friend ; and from the \n",
      "best , the purest of motives , might now be \n",
      "denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to \n",
      "divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon \n",
      "beginning her career of laborious duty . Upon the whole \n",
      ", Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings \n",
      ", as made her look around in walking home , \n",
      "and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of \n",
      "giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to \n",
      "scheme about for her . These were charming feelings -- \n",
      "but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by \n",
      "any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , \n",
      "or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and \n",
      "errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , `` She \n",
      "certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! \n",
      "'' Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her \n",
      "grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much \n",
      "into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The \n",
      "aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , \n",
      "because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration \n",
      "of her powers ; and they had to listen to \n",
      "the description of exactly how little bread and butter she \n",
      "ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of \n",
      "mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions \n",
      "of new caps and new workbags for her mother and \n",
      "herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again . They \n",
      "had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and \n",
      "the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her \n",
      "an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , \n",
      "meaning only to shew off in higher style her own \n",
      "very superior performance . She was , besides , which \n",
      "was the worst of all , so cold , so \n",
      "cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion \n",
      ". Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she \n",
      "seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , \n",
      "was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more \n",
      ", where all was most , she was more reserved \n",
      "on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any \n",
      "thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight \n",
      "into Mr. Dixon 's character , or her own value \n",
      "for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of \n",
      "the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness \n",
      "; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no \n",
      "service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma \n",
      "saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises \n",
      ". There probably _was_ something more to conceal than her \n",
      "own preference ; Mr. Dixon , perhaps , had been \n",
      "very near changing one friend for the other , or \n",
      "been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake \n",
      "of the future twelve thousand pounds . The like reserve \n",
      "prevailed on other topics . She and Mr. Frank Churchill \n",
      "had been at Weymouth at the same time . It \n",

      "a watering-place , or in a common London acquaintance , \n",

      "III Emma could not forgive her ; -- but as \n",
      "neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley , \n",
      "who had been of the party , and had seen \n",
      "only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , \n",
      "he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield \n",
      "again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of \n",
      "the whole ; not so openly as he might have \n",
      "done had her father been out of the room , \n",
      "but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma \n",
      ". He had been used to think her unjust to \n",
      "Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an \n",
      "improvement . `` A very pleasant evening , '' he \n",
      "began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked \n",
      "into what was necessary , told that he understood , \n",
      "and the papers swept away ; -- '' particularly pleasant \n",
      ". You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good \n",
      "music . I do not know a more luxurious state \n",
      ", sir , than sitting at one 's ease to \n",
      "be entertained a whole evening by two such young women \n",
      "; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I \n",
      "am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant \n",
      ", Emma . You left nothing undone . I was \n",
      "glad you made her play so much , for having \n",
      "no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have \n",
      "been a real indulgence . '' `` I am happy \n",
      "you approved , '' said Emma , smiling ; `` \n",
      "but I hope I am not often deficient in what \n",
      "is due to guests at Hartfield . '' `` No \n",
      ", my dear , '' said her father instantly ; \n",
      "`` _that_ I am sure you are not . There \n",
      "is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are \n",
      ". If any thing , you are too attentive . \n",
      "The muffin last night -- if it had been handed \n",
      "round once , I think it would have been enough \n",
      ". '' `` No , '' said Mr. Knightley , \n",
      "nearly at the same time ; `` you are not \n",
      "often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or \n",
      "comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore . \n",
      "'' An arch look expressed -- '' I understand you \n",
      "well enough ; '' but she said only , `` \n",
      "Miss Fairfax is reserved . '' `` I always told \n",
      "you she was -- a little ; but you will \n",
      "soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought \n",
      "to be overcome , all that has its foundation in \n",
      "diffidence . What arises from discretion must be honoured . \n",
      "'' `` You think her diffident . I do not \n",
      "see it . '' `` My dear Emma , '' \n",
      "said he , moving from his chair into one close \n",
      "by her , `` you are not going to tell \n",
      "me , I hope , that you had not a \n",
      "pleasant evening . '' `` Oh ! no ; I \n",
      "was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; \n",
      "and amused to think how little information I obtained . \n",
      "'' `` I am disappointed , '' was his only \n",
      "answer . `` I hope every body had a pleasant \n",

      "way . `` I had . Once , I felt \n",
      "the fire rather too much ; but then I moved \n",

      "is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in \n",
      "a different way . I like old friends ; and \n",
      "Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young \n",
      "lady , a very pretty and a very well-behaved young \n",
      "lady indeed . She must have found the evening agreeable \n",
      ", Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . '' \n",
      "`` True , sir ; and Emma , because she \n",
      "had Miss Fairfax . '' Emma saw his anxiety , \n",
      "and wishing to appease it , at least for the \n",
      "present , said , and with a sincerity which no \n",
      "one could question -- '' She is a sort of \n",
      "elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes \n",
      "from . I am always watching her to admire ; \n",
      "and I do pity her from my heart . '' \n",
      "Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than \n",
      "he cared to express ; and before he could make \n",
      "any reply , Mr. Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on \n",
      "the Bates 's , said -- '' It is a \n",
      "great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! \n",
      "a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished \n",
      "-- but it is so little one can venture to \n",
      "do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing \n",
      "uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and \n",
      "Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg \n",
      "; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork \n",
      "is not like any other pork -- but still it \n",
      "is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless \n",
      "one could be sure of their making it into steaks \n",
      ", nicely fried , as ours are fried , without \n",
      "the smallest grease , and not roast it , for \n",
      "no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we \n",
      "had better send the leg -- do not you think \n",
      "so , my dear ? '' `` My dear papa \n",
      ", I sent the whole hind-quarter . I knew you \n",
      "would wish it . There will be the leg to \n",
      "be salted , you know , which is so very \n",
      "nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in \n",
      "any manner they like . '' `` That 's right \n",
      ", my dear , very right . I had not \n",
      "thought of it before , but that is the best \n",
      "way . They must not over-salt the leg ; and \n",
      "then , if it is not over-salted , and if \n",
      "it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils \n",
      "ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a \n",
      "boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , \n",
      "I do not consider it unwholesome . '' `` Emma \n",
      ", '' said Mr. Knightley presently , `` I have \n",
      "a piece of news for you . You like news \n",
      "-- and I heard an article in my way hither \n",
      "that I think will interest you . '' `` News \n",

      "'' No , not at Randalls ; I have not \n",
      "been near Randalls , '' when the door was thrown \n",
      "open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into \n",
      "the room . Full of thanks , and full of \n",
      "news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest \n",
      ". Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his \n",
      "moment , and that not another syllable of communication could \n",
      "rest with him . `` Oh ! my dear sir \n",
      ", how are you this morning ? My dear Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse -- I come quite over-powered . Such a beautiful \n",
      "hind-quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have \n",
      "you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to \n",
      "be married . '' Emma had not had time even \n",
      "to think of Mr. Elton , and she was so \n",
      "completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start \n",
      ", and a little blush , at the sound . \n",
      "`` There is my news : -- I thought it \n",
      "would interest you , '' said Mr. Knightley , with \n",
      "a smile which implied a conviction of some part of \n",
      "what had passed between them . `` But where could \n",
      "_you_ hear it ? '' cried Miss Bates . `` \n",
      "Where could you possibly hear it , Mr. Knightley ? \n",
      "For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. \n",
      "Cole 's note -- no , it can not be \n",
      "more than five -- or at least ten -- for \n",
      "I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just \n",
      "ready to come out -- I was only gone down \n",
      "to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane \n",
      "was standing in the passage -- were not you , \n",
      "Jane ? -- for my mother was so afraid that \n",
      "we had not any salting-pan large enough . So I \n",
      "said I would go down and see , and Jane \n",
      "said , ` Shall I go down instead ? for \n",
      "I think you have a little cold , and Patty \n",
      "has been washing the kitchen. ' -- ` Oh ! \n",
      "my dear , ' said I -- well , and \n",
      "just then came the note . A Miss Hawkins -- \n",
      "that 's all I know . A Miss Hawkins of \n",
      "Bath . But , Mr. Knightley , how could you \n",
      "possibly have heard it ? for the very moment Mr. \n",
      "Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down \n",
      "and wrote to me . A Miss Hawkins -- '' \n",
      "'' I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour \n",
      "and a half ago . He had just read Elton \n",
      "'s letter as I was shewn in , and handed \n",

      "`` We consider our Hartfield pork , '' replied Mr. \n",

      "The information was , as you state , that he \n",

      "By his style , I should imagine it just settled \n",

      "! -- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I \n",
      "thought I should have fainted . I did not know \n",
      "what to do . I was sitting near the door \n",
      "-- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not \n",
      "; he was busy with the umbrella . I am \n",
      "sure she saw me , but she looked away directly \n",
      ", and took no notice ; and they both went \n",
      "to quite the farther end of the shop ; and \n",
      "I kept sitting near the door ! -- Oh ! \n",
      "dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure \n",
      "I must have been as white as my gown . \n",
      "I could not go away you know , because of \n",
      "the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere \n",
      "in the world but there. -- Oh ! dear , \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy \n",
      ", he looked round and saw me ; for instead \n",
      "of going on with her buyings , they began whispering \n",
      "to one another . I am sure they were talking \n",
      "of me ; and I could not help thinking that \n",
      "he was persuading her to speak to me -- ( \n",
      "do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ? ) \n",
      "-- for presently she came forward -- came quite up \n",
      "to me , and asked me how I did , \n",
      "and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would \n",
      ". She did not do any of it in the \n",
      "same way that she used ; I could see she \n",
      "was altered ; but , however , she seemed to \n",
      "_try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands \n",
      ", and stood talking some time ; but I know \n",
      "no more what I said -- I was in such \n",
      "a tremble ! -- I remember she said she was \n",
      "sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost \n",
      "too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was \n",
      "absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning \n",
      "to hold up , and I was determined that nothing \n",
      "should stop me from getting away -- and then -- \n",
      "only think ! -- I found he was coming up \n",
      "towards me too -- slowly you know , and as \n",
      "if he did not quite know what to do ; \n",
      "and so he came and spoke , and I answered \n",
      "-- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully \n",
      ", you know , one ca n't tell how ; \n",
      "and then I took courage , and said it did \n",
      "not rain , and I must go ; and so \n",
      "off I set ; and I had not got three \n",
      "yards from the door , when he came after me \n",
      ", only to say , if I was going to \n",
      "Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round \n",
      "by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find \n",
      "the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh \n",
      "! dear , I thought it would have been the \n",
      "death of me ! So I said , I was \n",
      "very much obliged to him : you know I could \n",
      "not do less ; and then he went back to \n",
      "Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- \n",
      "I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where \n",
      "I was , or any thing about it . Oh \n",
      "! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing \n",
      "than have it happen : and yet , you know \n",
      ", there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him \n",
      "behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , \n",
      "too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to \n",
      "me and make me comfortable again . '' Very sincerely \n",
      "did Emma wish to do so ; but it was \n",
      "not immediately in her power . She was obliged to \n",
      "stop and think . She was not thoroughly comfortable herself \n",
      ". The young man 's conduct , and his sister \n",
      "'s , seemed the result of real feeling , and \n",
      "she could not but pity them . As Harriet described \n",
      "it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded \n",
      "affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour . But she \n",
      "had believed them to be well-meaning , worthy people before \n",
      "; and what difference did this make in the evils \n",
      "of the connexion ? It was folly to be disturbed \n",
      "by it . Of course , he must be sorry \n",
      "to lose her -- they must be all sorry . \n",
      "Ambition , as well as love , had probably been \n",
      "mortified . They might all have hoped to rise by \n",
      "Harriet 's acquaintance : and besides , what was the \n",
      "value of Harriet 's description ? -- So easily pleased \n",
      "-- so little discerning ; -- what signified her praise \n",
      "? She exerted herself , and did try to make \n",
      "her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as \n",
      "a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt \n",
      "on , '' It might be distressing , for the \n",
      "moment , '' said she ; `` but you seem \n",
      "to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over \n",
      "-- and may never -- can never , as a \n",
      "first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need \n",
      "not think about it . '' Harriet said , `` \n",
      "very true , '' and she `` would not think \n",
      "about it ; '' but still she talked of it \n",
      "-- still she could talk of nothing else ; and \n",
      "Emma , at last , in order to put the \n",
      "Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry \n",
      "on the news , which she had meant to give \n",
      "with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether \n",
      "to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused \n",
      ", at such a state of mind in poor Harriet \n",
      "-- such a conclusion of Mr. Elton 's importance with \n",
      "her ! Mr. Elton 's rights , however , gradually \n",
      "revived . Though she did not feel the first intelligence \n",
      "as she might have done the day before , or \n",
      "an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and \n",
      "before their first conversation was over , she had talked \n",
      "herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and \n",
      "regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate \n",
      "Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins \n",
      "under proper subordination in her fancy . Emma learned to \n",
      "be rather glad that there had been such a meeting \n",
      ". It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock \n",
      ", without retaining any influence to alarm . As Harriet \n",
      "now lived , the Martins could not get at her \n",
      ", without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted \n",
      "either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; \n",
      "for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters \n",
      "never had been at Mrs. Goddard 's ; and a \n",
      "twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , \n",
      "with any necessity , or even any power of speech \n",
      ". CHAPTER IV Human nature is so well disposed towards \n",
      "those who are in interesting situations , that a young \n",
      "person , who either marries or dies , is sure \n",
      "of being kindly spoken of . A week had not \n",
      "passed since Miss Hawkins 's name was first mentioned in \n",
      "Highbury , before she was , by some means or \n",
      "other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and \n",
      "mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished \n",
      ", and perfectly amiable : and when Mr. Elton himself \n",
      "arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate \n",
      "the fame of her merits , there was very little \n",
      "more for him to do , than to tell her \n",
      "Christian name , and say whose music she principally played \n",
      ". Mr. Elton returned , a very happy man . \n",
      "He had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in \n",
      "a very sanguine hope , after a series of what \n",
      "appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing \n",
      "the right lady , but finding himself debased to the \n",
      "level of a very wrong one . He had gone \n",
      "away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another \n",
      "-- and to another as superior , of course , \n",
      "to the first , as under such circumstances what is \n",
      "gained always is to what is lost . He came \n",
      "back gay and self-satisfied , eager and busy , caring \n",
      "nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith . \n",
      "The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the \n",
      "usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in \n",
      "possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands \n",
      "as would always be called ten ; a point of \n",
      "some dignity , as well as some convenience : the \n",
      "story told well ; he had not thrown himself away \n",
      "-- he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or \n",
      "thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful \n",
      "rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so \n",
      "very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which \n",
      "he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and \n",
      "progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps \n",
      "so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the \n",
      "dinner at Mr. Green 's , and the party at \n",
      "Mrs. Brown 's -- smiles and blushes rising in importance \n",
      "-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady \n",
      "had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- \n",
      "had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase \n",
      ", been so very ready to have him , that \n",
      "vanity and prudence were equally contented . He had caught \n",
      "both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , \n",
      "and was just the happy man he ought to be \n",
      "; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- \n",
      "expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at \n",
      "-- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now \n",
      "addressing all the young ladies of the place , to \n",
      "whom , a few weeks ago , he would have \n",
      "been more cautiously gallant . The wedding was no distant \n",
      "event , as the parties had only themselves to please \n",
      ", and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for \n",
      "; and when he set out for Bath again , \n",
      "there was a general expectation , which a certain glance \n",
      "of Mrs. Cole 's did not seem to contradict , \n",
      "that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his \n",
      "bride . During his present short stay , Emma had \n",
      "barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that \n",
      "the first meeting was over , and to give her \n",
      "the impression of his not being improved by the mixture \n",
      "of pique and pretension , now spread over his air \n",
      ". She was , in fact , beginning very much \n",
      "to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at \n",
      "all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with \n",
      "some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a \n",
      "moral light , as a penance , a lesson , \n",
      "a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , \n",
      "she would have been thankful to be assured of never \n",
      "seeing him again . She wished him very well ; \n",
      "but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty \n",
      "miles off would administer most satisfaction . The pain of \n",
      "his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly \n",
      "be lessened by his marriage . Many vain solicitudes would \n",
      "be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it . A \n",
      "_Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of \n",
      "intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark . It \n",
      "would be almost beginning their life of civility again . \n",
      "Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little \n",
      ". She was good enough for Mr. Elton , no \n",
      "doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury -- handsome enough -- \n",
      "to look plain , probably , by Harriet 's side \n",
      ". As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy \n",
      "; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims \n",
      "and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing . \n",
      "On that article , truth seemed attainable . _What_ she \n",
      "was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was \n",
      ", might be found out ; and setting aside the \n",
      "10,000 l. , it did not appear that she was \n",
      "at all Harriet 's superior . She brought no name \n",
      ", no blood , no alliance . Miss Hawkins was \n",
      "the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol -- \n",
      "merchant , of course , he must be called ; \n",
      "but , as the whole of the profits of his \n",
      "mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not \n",
      "unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade \n",
      "had been very moderate also . Part of every winter \n",
      "she had been used to spend in Bath ; but \n",
      "Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol \n",
      "; for though the father and mother had died some \n",
      "years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law \n",
      "line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him \n",
      ", than that he was in the law line ; \n",
      "and with him the daughter had lived . Emma guessed \n",
      "him to be the drudge of some attorney , and \n",
      "too stupid to rise . And all the grandeur of \n",
      "the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who \n",
      "was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a \n",
      "_great_ _way_ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages \n",
      "! That was the wind-up of the history ; that \n",
      "was the glory of Miss Hawkins . Could she but \n",
      "have given Harriet her feelings about it all ! She \n",
      "had talked her into love ; but , alas ! \n",
      "she was not so easily to be talked out of \n",
      "it . The charm of an object to occupy the \n",
      "many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be \n",
      "talked away . He might be superseded by another ; \n",
      "he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; \n",
      "even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but \n",
      "nothing else , she feared , would cure her . \n",
      "Harriet was one of those , who , having once \n",
      "begun , would be always in love . And now \n",
      ", poor girl ! she was considerably worse from this \n",
      "reappearance of Mr. Elton . She was always having a \n",
      "glimpse of him somewhere or other . Emma saw him \n",
      "only once ; but two or three times every day \n",
      "Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him , or \n",
      "_just_ to miss him , _just_ to hear his voice \n",
      ", or see his shoulder , _just_ to have something \n",
      "occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all \n",
      "the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . She was \n",
      ", moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , \n",
      "excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those \n",
      "who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found \n",
      "nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; \n",
      "and every report , therefore , every guess -- all \n",
      "that had already occurred , all that might occur in \n",
      "the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants \n",
      ", and furniture , was continually in agitation around her \n",
      ". Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of \n",
      "him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings \n",
      "irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , \n",
      "and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached \n",
      "! -- his air as he walked by the house \n",
      "-- the very sitting of his hat , being all \n",
      "in proof of how much he was in love ! \n",
      "Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no \n",
      "pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , \n",
      "in the waverings of Harriet 's mind , Emma would \n",
      "have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr. Elton \n",
      "predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally \n",
      "useful as a check to the other . Mr. Elton's \n",
      "engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting \n",
      "Mr. Martin . The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of \n",
      "that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth \n",
      "Martin 's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards \n",
      ". Harriet had not been at home ; but a \n",
      "note had been prepared and left for her , written \n",
      "in the very style to touch ; a small mixture \n",
      "of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; \n",
      "and till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been \n",
      "much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could \n",
      "be done in return , and wishing to do more \n",
      "than she dared to confess . But Mr. Elton , \n",
      "in person , had driven away all such cares . \n",
      "While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and \n",
      "on the very morning of his setting off for Bath \n",
      "again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress \n",
      "it occasioned , judged it best for her to return \n",
      "Elizabeth Martin 's visit . How that visit was to \n",
      "be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what \n",
      "might be safest , had been a point of some \n",
      "doubtful consideration . Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters \n",
      ", when invited to come , would be ingratitude . \n",
      "It must not be : and yet the danger of \n",
      "a renewal of the acquaintance ! -- After much thinking \n",
      ", she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet's \n",
      "returning the visit ; but in a way that , \n",
      "if they had understanding , should convince them that it \n",
      "was to be only a formal acquaintance . She meant \n",
      "to take her in the carriage , leave her at \n",
      "the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther \n",
      ", and call for her again so soon , as \n",
      "to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences \n",
      "to the past , and give the most decided proof \n",
      "of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future \n",
      ". She could think of nothing better : and though \n",
      "there was something in it which her own heart could \n",
      "not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over \n",
      "-- it must be done , or what would become \n",
      "of Harriet ? CHAPTER V Small heart had Harriet for \n",
      "visiting . Only half an hour before her friend called \n",
      "for her at Mrs. Goddard 's , her evil stars \n",
      "had led her to the very spot where , at \n",
      "that moment , a trunk , directed to _The_ _Rev._ \n",
      "_Philip_ _Elton_ , _White-Hart_ , _Bath_ , was to be \n",
      "seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher \n",
      "'s cart , which was to convey it to where \n",
      "the coaches past ; and every thing in this world \n",
      ", excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently \n",
      "a blank . She went , however ; and when \n",
      "they reached the farm , and she was to be \n",
      "put down , at the end of the broad , \n",
      "neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple-trees to \n",
      "the front door , the sight of every thing which \n",
      "had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , \n",
      "was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and \n",
      "when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking \n",
      "around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined \n",
      "her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed \n",
      "quarter of an hour . She went on herself , \n",
      "to give that portion of time to an old servant \n",
      "who was married , and settled in Donwell . The \n",
      "quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white \n",
      "gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , \n",
      "was with her without delay , and unattended by any \n",
      "alarming young man . She came solitarily down the gravel \n",
      "walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door \n",
      ", and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility . \n",
      "Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account . \n",
      "She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma \n",
      "collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting \n",
      ", and the sort of pain it was creating . \n",
      "She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls \n",
      ". They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly \n",
      "; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked \n",
      "almost all the time -- till just at last , \n",
      "when Mrs. Martin 's saying , all of a sudden \n",
      ", that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had \n",
      "brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer \n",
      "manner . In that very room she had been measured \n",
      "last September , with her two friends . There were \n",
      "the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the \n",
      "window . _He_ had done it . They all seemed \n",
      "to remember the day , the hour , the party \n",
      ", the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , \n",
      "the same regrets -- to be ready to return to \n",
      "the same good understanding ; and they were just growing \n",
      "again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must \n",
      "suspect , as ready as the best of them to \n",
      "be cordial and happy , ) when the carriage reappeared \n",
      ", and all was over . The style of the \n",
      "visit , and the shortness of it , were then \n",
      "felt to be decisive . Fourteen minutes to be given \n",
      "to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks \n",
      "not six months ago ! -- Emma could not but \n",
      "picture it all , and feel how justly they might \n",
      "resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer . It was \n",
      "a bad business . She would have given a great \n",
      "deal , or endured a great deal , to have \n",
      "had the Martins in a higher rank of life . \n",
      "They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should \n",
      "have been enough : but as it was , how \n",
      "could she have done otherwise ? -- Impossible ! -- \n",
      "She could not repent . They must be separated ; \n",
      "but there was a great deal of pain in the \n",
      "process -- so much to herself at this time , \n",
      "that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation \n",
      ", and resolved on going home by way of Randalls \n",
      "to procure it . Her mind was quite sick of \n",
      "Mr. Elton and the Martins . The refreshment of Randalls \n",
      "was absolutely necessary . It was a good scheme ; \n",
      "but on driving to the door they heard that neither \n",
      "`` master nor mistress was at home ; '' they \n",
      "had both been out some time ; the man believed \n",
      "they were gone to Hartfield . `` This is too \n",
      "bad , '' cried Emma , as they turned away \n",
      ". `` And now we shall just miss them ; \n",
      "too provoking ! -- I do not know when I \n",
      "have been so disappointed . '' And she leaned back \n",
      "in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or \n",
      "to reason them away ; probably a little of both \n",
      "-- such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed \n",
      "mind . Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up \n",
      "; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston , \n",
      "who were standing to speak to her . There was \n",
      "instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still \n",
      "greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr. Weston \n",
      "immediately accosted her with , '' How d 'ye do \n",
      "? -- how d 'ye do ? -- We have \n",
      "been sitting with your father -- glad to see him \n",
      "so well . Frank comes to-morrow -- I had a \n",
      "letter this morning -- we see him to-morrow by dinner-time \n",
      "to a certainty -- he is at Oxford to-day , \n",
      "and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew \n",
      "it would be so . If he had come at \n",
      "Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I \n",
      "was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; \n",
      "now we are going to have just the right weather \n",
      "for him , fine , dry , settled weather . \n",
      "We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned \n",
      "out exactly as we could wish . '' There was \n",
      "no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the \n",
      "influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston 's \n",
      ", confirmed as it all was by the words and \n",
      "the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , \n",
      "but not less to the purpose . To know that \n",
      "_she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma \n",
      "consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in \n",
      "their joy . It was a most delightful reanimation of \n",
      "exhausted spirits . The worn-out past was sunk in the \n",
      "freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity \n",
      "of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. \n",
      "Elton would now be talked of no more . Mr. \n",
      "Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe \n",
      ", which allowed his son to answer for having an \n",
      "entire fortnight at his command , as well as the \n",
      "route and the method of his journey ; and she \n",
      "listened , and smiled , and congratulated . `` I \n",
      "shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , '' said \n",
      "he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she \n",
      "saw a touch of the arm at this speech , \n",
      "from his wife . `` We had better move on \n",
      ", Mr. Weston , '' said she , `` we \n",
      "are detaining the girls . '' `` Well , well \n",
      ", I am ready ; '' -- and turning again \n",
      "to Emma , `` but you must not be expecting \n",
      "such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only \n",
      "had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he \n",
      "is really nothing extraordinary : '' -- though his own \n",
      "sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different \n",
      "conviction . Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , \n",
      "and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing . `` \n",
      "Think of me to-morrow , my dear Emma , about \n",
      "four o'clock , '' was Mrs. Weston 's parting injunction \n",
      "; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for \n",
      "her . `` Four o'clock ! -- depend upon it \n",
      "he will be here by three , '' was Mr. \n",
      "Weston's quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory \n",
      "meeting . Emma 's spirits were mounted quite up to \n",
      "happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James \n",
      "and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before \n",
      ". When she looked at the hedges , she thought \n",
      "the elder at least must soon be coming out ; \n",
      "and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw \n",
      "something like a look of spring , a tender smile \n",
      "even there . `` Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through \n",
      "Bath as well as Oxford ? '' -- was a \n",
      "question , however , which did not augur much . \n",
      "But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once \n",
      ", and Emma was now in a humour to resolve \n",
      "that they should both come in time . The morning \n",
      "of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs. Weston's faithful \n",
      "pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven \n",
      ", or twelve o'clock , that she was to think \n",
      "of her at four . `` My dear , dear \n",
      "anxious friend , '' -- said she , in mental \n",
      "soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , \n",
      "`` always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your \n",
      "own ; I see you now in all your little \n",
      "fidgets , going again and again into his room , \n",
      "to be sure that all is right . '' The \n",
      "clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall . \n",
      "`` 'T is twelve ; I shall not forget to \n",
      "think of you four hours hence ; and by this \n",
      "time to-morrow , perhaps , or a little later , \n",
      "I may be thinking of the possibility of their all \n",
      "calling here . I am sure they will bring him \n",
      "soon . '' She opened the parlour door , and \n",
      "saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr. Weston \n",
      "and his son . They had been arrived only a \n",
      "few minutes , and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his \n",
      "explanation of Frank 's being a day before his time \n",
      ", and her father was yet in the midst of \n",
      "his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared \n",
      ", to have her share of surprize , introduction , \n",
      "and pleasure . The Frank Churchill so long talked of \n",
      ", so high in interest , was actually before her \n",
      "-- he was presented to her , and she did \n",
      "not think too much had been said in his praise \n",
      "; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; \n",
      "height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , \n",
      "and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit \n",
      "and liveliness of his father 's ; he looked quick \n",
      "and sensible . She felt immediately that she should like \n",
      "him ; and there was a well-bred ease of manner \n",
      ", and a readiness to talk , which convinced her \n",
      "that he came intending to be acquainted with her , \n",
      "and that acquainted they soon must be . He had \n",
      "reached Randalls the evening before . She was pleased with \n",
      "the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his \n",
      "plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker \n",
      ", that he might gain half a day . `` \n",
      "I told you yesterday , '' cried Mr. Weston with \n",
      "exultation , `` I told you all that he would \n",
      "be here before the time named . I remembered what \n",
      "I used to do myself . One can not creep \n",
      "upon a journey ; one can not help getting on \n",
      "faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of \n",
      "coming in upon one 's friends before the look-out begins \n",
      ", is worth a great deal more than any little \n",
      "exertion it needs . '' `` It is a great \n",
      "pleasure where one can indulge in it , '' said \n",
      "the young man , '' though there are not many \n",
      "houses that I should presume on so far ; but \n",
      "in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing \n",
      ". '' The word _home_ made his father look on \n",
      "him with fresh complacency . Emma was directly sure that \n",
      "he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction \n",
      "was strengthened by what followed . He was very much \n",
      "pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged \n",
      "house , would hardly allow it even to be very \n",
      "small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury \n",
      ", Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed \n",
      "himself to have always felt the sort of interest in \n",
      "the country which none but one 's _own_ country gives \n",
      ", and the greatest curiosity to visit it . That \n",
      "he should never have been able to indulge so amiable \n",
      "a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma 's brain \n",
      "; but still , if it were a falsehood , \n",
      "it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled . \n",
      "His manner had no air of study or exaggeration . \n",
      "He did really look and speak as if in a \n",
      "state of no common enjoyment . Their subjects in general \n",
      "were such as belong to an opening acquaintance . On \n",
      "his side were the inquiries , -- '' Was she \n",
      "a horsewoman ? -- Pleasant rides ? -- Pleasant walks \n",
      "? -- Had they a large neighbourhood ? -- Highbury \n",
      ", perhaps , afforded society enough ? -- There were \n",
      "several very pretty houses in and about it. -- Balls \n",
      "-- had they balls ? -- Was it a musical \n",
      "society ? '' But when satisfied on all these points \n",
      ", and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to \n",
      "find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged \n",
      "with each other , of introducing his mother-in-law , and \n",
      "speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so \n",
      "much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness \n",
      "she secured to his father , and her very kind \n",
      "reception of himself , as was an additional proof of \n",
      "his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly \n",
      "thinking it worth while to try to please her . \n",
      "He did not advance a word of praise beyond what \n",
      "she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston ; \n",
      "but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the \n",
      "matter . He understood what would be welcome ; he \n",
      "could be sure of little else . `` His father \n",
      "'s marriage , '' he said , '' had been \n",
      "the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it \n",
      "; and the family from whom he had received such \n",
      "a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the \n",
      "highest obligation on him . '' He got as near \n",
      "as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor 's \n",
      "merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the \n",
      "common course of things it was to be rather supposed \n",
      "that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's character , than \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor 's . And at last , \n",
      "as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling \n",
      "round to its object , he wound it all up \n",
      "with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person \n",
      ". `` Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared \n",
      "for , '' said he ; '' but I confess \n",
      "that , considering every thing , I had not expected \n",
      "more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain \n",
      "age ; I did not know that I was to \n",
      "find a pretty young woman in Mrs . Weston . \n",
      "'' `` You can not see too much perfection in \n",
      "Mrs. Weston for my feelings , '' said Emma ; \n",
      "`` were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , \n",
      "I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be \n",
      "ready to quarrel with you for using such words . \n",
      "Do n't let her imagine that you have spoken of \n",
      "her as a pretty young woman . '' `` I \n",
      "hope I should know better , '' he replied ; \n",
      "`` no , depend upon it , ( with a \n",
      "gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I \n",
      "should understand whom I might praise without any danger of \n",
      "being thought extravagant in my terms . '' Emma wondered \n",
      "whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from \n",
      "their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession \n",
      "of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and \n",
      "whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of \n",
      "acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . She must see \n",
      "more of him to understand his ways ; at present \n",
      "she only felt they were agreeable . She had no \n",
      "doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about . \n",
      "His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards \n",
      "them with a happy expression ; and even , when \n",
      "he might have determined not to look , she was \n",
      "confident that he was often listening . Her own father \n",
      "'s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , \n",
      "the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of \n",
      "penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance . \n",
      "Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from \n",
      "foreseeing it. -- Though always objecting to every marriage that \n",
      "was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension \n",
      "of any ; it seemed as if he could not \n",
      "think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to \n",
      "suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against \n",
      "them . She blessed the favouring blindness . He could \n",
      "now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise \n",
      ", without a glance forward at any possible treachery in \n",
      "his guest , give way to all his natural kind-hearted \n",
      "civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill 's accommodation \n",
      "on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping \n",
      "two nights on the road , and express very genuine \n",
      "unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching \n",
      "cold -- which , however , he could not allow \n",
      "him to feel quite assured of himself till after another \n",
      "night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr. Weston began \n",
      "to move. -- '' He must be going . He \n",
      "had business at the Crown about his hay , and \n",
      "a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's \n",
      ", but he need not hurry any body else . \n",
      "'' His son , too well bred to hear the \n",
      "hint , rose immediately also , saying , '' As \n",
      "you are going farther on business , sir , I \n",
      "will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which \n",
      "must be paid some day or other , and therefore \n",
      "may as well be paid now . I have the \n",
      "honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , \n",
      "( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in \n",
      "or near Highbury ; a family of the name of \n",
      "Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose \n",
      ", in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I \n",
      "believe , is not the proper name -- I should \n",
      "rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know \n",
      "any family of that name ? '' `` To be \n",
      "sure we do , '' cried his father ; `` \n",
      "Mrs. Bates -- we passed her house -- I saw \n",
      "Miss Bates at the window . True , true , \n",
      "you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you \n",
      "knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she \n",
      "is . Call upon her , by all means . \n",
      "'' `` There is no necessity for my calling this \n",
      "morning , '' said the young man ; `` another \n",
      "day would do as well ; but there was that \n",
      "degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which -- '' '' Oh \n",
      "! go to-day , go to-day . Do not defer \n",
      "it . What is right to be done can not \n",
      "be done too soon . And , besides , I \n",
      "must give you a hint , Frank ; any want \n",
      "of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided . \n",
      "You saw her with the Campbells , when she was \n",
      "the equal of every body she mixed with , but \n",
      "here she is with a poor old grandmother , who \n",
      "has barely enough to live on . If you do \n",
      "not call early it will be a slight . '' \n",
      "The son looked convinced . `` I have heard her \n",
      "speak of the acquaintance , '' said Emma ; `` \n",
      "she is a very elegant young woman . '' He \n",
      "agreed to it , but with so quiet a `` \n",
      "Yes , '' as inclined her almost to doubt his \n",
      "real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very \n",
      "distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if \n",
      "Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it \n",
      ". `` If you were never particularly struck by her \n",
      "manners before , '' said she , `` I think \n",
      "you will to-day . You will see her to advantage \n",
      "; see her and hear her -- no , I \n",
      "am afraid you will not hear her at all , \n",
      "for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue \n",
      ". '' `` You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax \n",
      ", sir , are you ? '' said Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      ", always the last to make his way in conversation \n",
      "; '' then give me leave to assure you that \n",
      "you will find her a very agreeable young lady . \n",
      "She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama \n",
      "and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known \n",
      "them all my life . They will be extremely glad \n",
      "to see you , I am sure ; and one \n",
      "of my servants shall go with you to shew you \n",
      "the way . '' `` My dear sir , upon \n",
      "no account in the world ; my father can direct \n",
      "me . '' `` But your father is not going \n",
      "so far ; he is only going to the Crown \n",
      ", quite on the other side of the street , \n",
      "and there are a great many houses ; you might \n",
      "be very much at a loss , and it is \n",
      "a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the \n",
      "footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you \n",
      "had best cross the street . '' Mr. Frank Churchill \n",
      "still declined it , looking as serious as he could \n",
      ", and his father gave his hearty support by calling \n",
      "out , `` My good friend , this is quite \n",
      "unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he \n",
      "sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates 's , \n",
      "he may get there from the Crown in a hop \n",
      ", step , and jump . '' They were permitted \n",
      "to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from \n",
      "one , and a graceful bow from the other , \n",
      "the two gentlemen took leave . Emma remained very well \n",
      "pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could \n",
      "now engage to think of them all at Randalls any \n",
      "hour of the day , with full confidence in their \n",
      "comfort . CHAPTER VI The next morning brought Mr. Frank \n",
      "Churchill again . He came with Mrs. Weston , to \n",
      "whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially \n",
      ". He had been sitting with her , it appeared \n",
      ", most companionably at home , till her usual hour \n",
      "of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their \n",
      "walk , immediately fixed on Highbury. -- '' He did \n",
      "not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction \n",
      ", but if left to him , he should always \n",
      "chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful \n",
      ", happy-looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . \n",
      "'' -- Highbury , with Mrs. Weston , stood for \n",
      "Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same \n",
      "construction with him . They walked thither directly . Emma \n",
      "had hardly expected them : for Mr. Weston , who \n",
      "had called in for half a minute , in order \n",
      "to hear that his son was very handsome , knew \n",
      "nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable \n",
      "surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking \n",
      "up to the house together , arm in arm . \n",
      "She was wanting to see him again , and especially \n",
      "to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon \n",
      "his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to \n",
      "depend . If he were deficient there , nothing should \n",
      "make amends for it . But on seeing them together \n",
      ", she became perfectly satisfied . It was not merely \n",
      "in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his \n",
      "duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than \n",
      "his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably \n",
      "denote his wish of considering her as a friend and \n",
      "securing her affection . And there was time enough for \n",
      "Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit \n",
      "included all the rest of the morning . They were \n",
      "all three walking about together for an hour or two \n",
      "-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards \n",
      "in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; \n",
      "admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and \n",
      "when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his \n",
      "wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , \n",
      "and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than \n",
      "Emma could have supposed . Some of the objects of \n",
      "his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings . He begged to \n",
      "be shewn the house which his father had lived in \n",
      "so long , and which had been the home of \n",
      "his father 's father ; and on recollecting that an \n",
      "old woman who had nursed him was still living , \n",
      "walked in quest of her cottage from one end of \n",
      "the street to the other ; and though in some \n",
      "points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit \n",
      ", they shewed , altogether , a good-will towards Highbury \n",
      "in general , which must be very like a merit \n",
      "to those he was with . Emma watched and decided \n",
      ", that with such feelings as were now shewn , \n",
      "it could not be fairly supposed that he had been \n",
      "ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been \n",
      "acting a part , or making a parade of insincere \n",
      "professions ; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done \n",
      "him justice . Their first pause was at the Crown \n",
      "Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one \n",
      "of the sort , where a couple of pair of \n",
      "post-horses were kept , more for the convenience of the \n",
      "neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and \n",
      "his companions had not expected to be detained by any \n",
      "interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave \n",
      "the history of the large room visibly added ; it \n",
      "had been built many years ago for a ball-room , \n",
      "and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous \n",
      ", dancing state , had been occasionally used as such \n",
      "; -- but such brilliant days had long passed away \n",
      ", and now the highest purpose for which it was \n",
      "ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among \n",
      "the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place . He was \n",
      "immediately interested . Its character as a ball-room caught him \n",
      "; and instead of passing on , he stopt for \n",
      "several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were \n",
      "open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , \n",
      "and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . \n",
      "He saw no fault in the room , he would \n",
      "acknowledge none which they suggested . No , it was \n",
      "long enough , broad enough , handsome enough . It \n",
      "would hold the very number for comfort . They ought \n",
      "to have balls there at least every fortnight through the \n",
      "winter . Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former \n",
      "good old days of the room ? -- She who \n",
      "could do any thing in Highbury ! The want of \n",
      "proper families in the place , and the conviction that \n",
      "none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be \n",
      "tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was \n",
      "not satisfied . He could not be persuaded that so \n",
      "many good-looking houses as he saw around him , could \n",
      "not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and \n",
      "even when particulars were given and families described , he \n",
      "was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such \n",
      "a mixture would be any thing , or that there \n",
      "would be the smallest difficulty in every body 's returning \n",
      "into their proper place the next morning . He argued \n",
      "like a young man very much bent on dancing ; \n",
      "and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of \n",
      "the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the \n",
      "Churchills . He seemed to have all the life and \n",
      "spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his \n",
      "father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of \n",
      "Enscombe . Of pride , indeed , there was , \n",
      "perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion \n",
      "of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind \n",
      ". He could be no judge , however , of \n",
      "the evil he was holding cheap . It was but \n",
      "an effusion of lively spirits . At last he was \n",
      "persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown \n",
      "; and being now almost facing the house where the \n",
      "Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day \n",
      "before , and asked him if he had paid it \n",
      ". `` Yes , oh ! yes '' -- he \n",
      "replied ; `` I was just going to mention it \n",
      ". A very successful visit : -- I saw all \n",
      "the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to \n",
      "you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt \n",
      "had taken me quite by surprize , it must have \n",
      "been the death of me . As it was , \n",
      "I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit \n",
      ". Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary \n",
      ", perhaps all that was proper ; and I had \n",
      "told my father I should certainly be at home before \n",
      "him -- but there was no getting away , no \n",
      "pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I \n",
      "found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) \n",
      "joined me there at last , that I had been \n",
      "actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour \n",
      ". The good lady had not given me the possibility \n",
      "of escape before . '' `` And how did you \n",
      "think Miss Fairfax looking ? '' `` Ill , very \n",
      "ill -- that is , if a young lady can \n",
      "ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression \n",
      "is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? \n",
      "Ladies can never look ill. And , seriously , Miss \n",
      "Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to \n",
      "give the appearance of ill health. -- A most deplorable \n",
      "want of complexion . '' Emma would not agree to \n",
      "this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax \n",
      "'s complexion . `` It was certainly never brilliant , \n",
      "but she would not allow it to have a sickly \n",
      "hue in general ; and there was a softness and \n",
      "delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the \n",
      "character of her face . '' He listened with all \n",
      "due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people \n",
      "say the same -- but yet he must confess , \n",
      "that to him nothing could make amends for the want \n",
      "of the fine glow of health . Where features were \n",
      "indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all \n",
      "; and where they were good , the effect was \n",
      "-- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the \n",
      "effect was . `` Well , '' said Emma , \n",
      "`` there is no disputing about taste. -- At least \n",
      "you admire her except her complexion . '' He shook \n",
      "his head and laughed. -- '' I can not separate \n",
      "Miss Fairfax and her complexion . '' `` Did you \n",
      "see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in \n",
      "the same society ? '' At this moment they were \n",
      "approaching Ford 's , and he hastily exclaimed , '' \n",
      "Ha ! this must be the very shop that every \n",
      "body attends every day of their lives , as my \n",
      "father informs me . He comes to Highbury himself , \n",
      "he says , six days out of the seven , \n",
      "and has always business at Ford 's . If it \n",
      "be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go \n",
      "in , that I may prove myself to belong to \n",
      "the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury \n",
      ". I must buy something at Ford 's . It \n",
      "will be taking out my freedom. -- I dare say \n",
      "they sell gloves . '' `` Oh ! yes , \n",
      "gloves and every thing . I do admire your patriotism \n",
      ". You will be adored in Highbury . You were \n",
      "very popular before you came , because you were Mr. \n",
      "Weston 's son -- but lay out half a guinea \n",
      "at Ford 's , and your popularity will stand upon \n",
      "your own virtues . '' They went in ; and \n",
      "while the sleek , well-tied parcels of `` Men 's \n",
      "Beavers '' and `` York Tan '' were bringing down \n",
      "and displaying on the counter , he said -- '' \n",
      "But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you \n",
      "were speaking to me , you were saying something at \n",
      "the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ \n",
      ". Do not let me lose it . I assure \n",
      "you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make \n",
      "me amends for the loss of any happiness in private \n",
      "life . '' `` I merely asked , whether you \n",
      "had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at \n",
      "Weymouth . '' `` And now that I understand your \n",
      "question , I must pronounce it to be a very \n",
      "unfair one . It is always the lady 's right \n",
      "to decide on the degree of acquaintance . Miss Fairfax \n",
      "must already have given her account. -- I shall not \n",
      "commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to \n",
      "allow . '' `` Upon my word ! you answer \n",
      "as discreetly as she could do herself . But her \n",
      "account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed \n",
      ", she is so very reserved , so very unwilling \n",
      "to give the least information about any body , that \n",
      "I really think you may say what you like of \n",
      "your acquaintance with her . '' `` May I , \n",
      "indeed ? -- Then I will speak the truth , \n",
      "and nothing suits me so well . I met her \n",
      "frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a \n",
      "little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very \n",
      "much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a \n",
      "very agreeable man , and Mrs. Campbell a friendly , \n",
      "warm-hearted woman . I like them all . '' `` \n",
      "You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I \n",
      "conclude ; what she is destined to be ? '' \n",
      "`` Yes -- ( rather hesitatingly ) -- I believe \n",
      "I do . '' `` You get upon delicate subjects \n",
      ", Emma , '' said Mrs. Weston smiling ; '' \n",
      "remember that I am here. -- Mr . Frank Churchill \n",
      "hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss \n",
      "Fairfax 's situation in life . I will move a \n",
      "little farther off . '' `` I certainly do forget \n",
      "to think of _her_ , '' said Emma , `` \n",
      "as having ever been any thing but my friend and \n",
      "my dearest friend . '' He looked as if he \n",
      "fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . When the \n",
      "gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop \n",
      "again , '' Did you ever hear the young lady \n",
      "we were speaking of , play ? '' said Frank \n",
      "Churchill . `` Ever hear her ! '' repeated Emma \n",
      ". `` You forget how much she belongs to Highbury \n",
      ". I have heard her every year of our lives \n",
      "since we both began . She plays charmingly . '' \n",
      "`` You think so , do you ? -- I \n",
      "wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge \n",
      ". She appeared to me to play well , that \n",
      "is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing \n",
      "of the matter myself. -- I am excessively fond of \n",
      "music , but without the smallest skill or right of \n",
      "judging of any body 's performance. -- I have been \n",
      "used to hear her 's admired ; and I remember \n",
      "one proof of her being thought to play well : \n",
      "-- a man , a very musical man , and \n",
      "in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- \n",
      "on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask \n",
      "that other woman to sit down to the instrument , \n",
      "if the lady in question could sit down instead -- \n",
      "never seemed to like to hear one if he could \n",
      "hear the other . That , I thought , in \n",
      "a man of known musical talent , was some proof \n",
      ". '' `` Proof indeed ! '' said Emma , \n",
      "highly amused. -- '' Mr . Dixon is very musical \n",
      ", is he ? We shall know more about them \n",
      "all , in half an hour , from you , \n",
      "than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year \n",
      ". '' `` Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell \n",
      "were the persons ; and I thought it a very \n",
      "strong proof . '' `` Certainly -- very strong it \n",
      "was ; to own the truth , a great deal \n",
      "stronger than , if _I_ had been Miss Campbell , \n",
      "would have been at all agreeable to me . I \n",
      "could not excuse a man 's having more music than \n",
      "love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute \n",
      "sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How \n",
      "did Miss Campbell appear to like it ? '' `` \n",
      "It was her very particular friend , you know . \n",
      "'' `` Poor comfort ! '' said Emma , laughing \n",
      ". `` One would rather have a stranger preferred than \n",
      "one 's very particular friend -- with a stranger it \n",
      "might not recur again -- but the misery of having \n",
      "a very particular friend always at hand , to do \n",
      "every thing better than one does oneself ! -- Poor \n",
      "Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is \n",
      "gone to settle in Ireland . '' `` You are \n",
      "right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell \n",
      "; but she really did not seem to feel it \n",
      ". '' `` So much the better -- or so \n",
      "much the worse : -- I do not know which \n",
      ". But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in \n",
      "her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling \n",
      "-- there was one person , I think , who \n",
      "must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She \n",
      "must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . '' \n",
      "`` As to that -- I do not -- '' \n",
      "'' Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an \n",
      "account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you , or from \n",
      "any body else . They are known to no human \n",
      "being , I guess , but herself . But if \n",
      "she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. \n",
      "Dixon , one may guess what one chuses . '' \n",
      "`` There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them \n",
      "all -- '' he began rather quickly , but checking \n",
      "himself , added , `` however , it is impossible \n",
      "for me to say on what terms they really were \n",
      "-- how it might all be behind the scenes . \n",
      "I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . \n",
      "But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a \n",
      "child , must be a better judge of her character \n",
      ", and of how she is likely to conduct herself \n",
      "in critical situations , than I can be . '' \n",
      "`` I have known her from a child , undoubtedly \n",
      "; we have been children and women together ; and \n",
      "it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate \n",
      ", -- that we should have taken to each other \n",
      "whenever she visited her friends . But we never did \n",
      ". I hardly know how it has happened ; a \n",
      "little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side \n",
      "which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so \n",
      "idolized and so cried up as she always was , \n",
      "by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set \n",
      ". And then , her reserve -- I never could \n",
      "attach myself to any one so completely reserved . '' \n",
      "`` It is a most repulsive quality , indeed , \n",
      "'' said he . `` Oftentimes very convenient , no \n",
      "doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in \n",
      "reserve , but no attraction . One can not love \n",
      "a reserved person . '' `` Not till the reserve \n",
      "ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be \n",
      "the greater . But I must be more in want \n",
      "of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than \n",
      "I have yet been , to take the trouble of \n",
      "conquering any body 's reserve to procure one . Intimacy \n",
      "between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the \n",
      "question . I have no reason to think ill of \n",
      "her -- not the least -- except that such extreme \n",
      "and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a \n",
      "dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , \n",
      "is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to \n",
      "conceal . '' He perfectly agreed with her : and \n",
      "after walking together so long , and thinking so much \n",
      "alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him \n",
      ", that she could hardly believe it to be only \n",
      "their second meeting . He was not exactly what she \n",
      "had expected ; less of the man of the world \n",
      "in some of his notions , less of the spoiled \n",
      "child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected \n",
      ". His ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer \n",
      ". She was particularly struck by his manner of considering \n",
      "Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as \n",
      "the church , he would go and look at , \n",
      "and would not join them in finding much fault with \n",
      ". No , he could not believe it a bad \n",
      "house ; not such a house as a man was \n",
      "to be pitied for having . If it were to \n",
      "be shared with the woman he loved , he could \n",
      "not think any man to be pitied for having that \n",
      "house . There must be ample room in it for \n",
      "every real comfort . The man must be a blockhead \n",
      "who wanted more . Mrs. Weston laughed , and said \n",
      "he did not know what he was talking about . \n",
      "Used only to a large house himself , and without \n",
      "ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to \n",
      "its size , he could be no judge of the \n",
      "privations inevitably belonging to a small one . But Emma \n",
      ", in her own mind , determined that he _did_ \n",
      "know what he was talking about , and that he \n",
      "shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life \n",
      ", and to marry , from worthy motives . He \n",
      "might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace \n",
      "to be occasioned by no housekeeper 's room , or \n",
      "a bad butler 's pantry , but no doubt he \n",
      "did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy \n",
      ", and that whenever he were attached , he would \n",
      "willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an \n",
      "early establishment . CHAPTER VII Emma 's very good opinion \n",
      "of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day \n",
      ", by hearing that he was gone off to London \n",
      ", merely to have his hair cut . A sudden \n",
      "freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and \n",
      "he had sent for a chaise and set off , \n",
      "intending to return to dinner , but with no more \n",
      "important view that appeared than having his hair cut . \n",
      "There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles \n",
      "twice over on such an errand ; but there was \n",
      "an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she \n",
      "could not approve . It did not accord with the \n",
      "rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or \n",
      "even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had \n",
      "believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , \n",
      "extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , \n",
      "which must be doing something , good or bad ; \n",
      "heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. \n",
      "Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear \n",
      "in general ; he became liable to all these charges \n",
      ". His father only called him a coxcomb , and \n",
      "thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. \n",
      "Weston did not like it , was clear enough , \n",
      "by her passing it over as quickly as possible , \n",
      "and making no other comment than that `` all young \n",
      "people would have their little whims . '' With the \n",
      "exception of this little blot , Emma found that his \n",
      "visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of \n",
      "him . Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how \n",
      "attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how \n",
      "much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . \n",
      "He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly \n",
      "a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe \n",
      "nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly \n",
      "right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard \n",
      ", was fond of talking of him -- said he \n",
      "would be the best man in the world if he \n",
      "were left to himself ; and though there was no \n",
      "being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness \n",
      "with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak \n",
      "of her with respect . This was all very promising \n",
      "; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for \n",
      "having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote \n",
      "him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had \n",
      "given him ; the honour , if not of being \n",
      "really in love with her , of being at least \n",
      "very near it , and saved only by her own \n",
      "indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never \n",
      "marrying ) -- the honour , in short , of \n",
      "being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance \n",
      ". Mr. Weston , on his side , added a \n",
      "virtue to the account which must have some weight . \n",
      "He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely \n",
      "-- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and \n",
      "with so much to be said for him altogether , \n",
      "she found she must not judge him harshly . As \n",
      "Mrs. Weston observed , `` all young people would have \n",
      "their little whims . '' There was one person among \n",
      "his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed \n",
      ". In general he was judged , throughout the parishes \n",
      "of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal \n",
      "allowances were made for the little excesses of such a \n",
      "handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and \n",
      "bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among \n",
      "them not to be softened , from its power of \n",
      "censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr. Knightley . \n",
      "The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the \n",
      "moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him \n",
      "almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper \n",
      "he held in his hand , '' Hum ! just \n",
      "the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . \n",
      "'' She had half a mind to resent ; but \n",
      "an instant 's observation convinced her that it was really \n",
      "said only to relieve his own feelings , and not \n",
      "meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass \n",
      ". Although in one instance the bearers of not good \n",
      "tidings , Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's visit this morning \n",
      "was in another respect particularly opportune . Something occurred while \n",
      "they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their \n",
      "advice ; and , which was still more lucky , \n",
      "she wanted exactly the advice they gave . This was \n",
      "the occurrence : -- The Coles had been settled some \n",
      "years in Highbury , and were very good sort of \n",
      "people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but \n",
      ", on the other hand , they were of low \n",
      "origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel . \n",
      "On their first coming into the country , they had \n",
      "lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping \n",
      "little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the \n",
      "last year or two had brought them a considerable increase \n",
      "of means -- the house in town had yielded greater \n",
      "profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them \n",
      ". With their wealth , their views increased ; their \n",
      "want of a larger house , their inclination for more \n",
      "company . They added to their house , to their \n",
      "number of servants , to their expenses of every sort \n",
      "; and by this time were , in fortune and \n",
      "style of living , second only to the family at \n",
      "Hartfield . Their love of society , and their new \n",
      "dining-room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company ; \n",
      "and a few parties , chiefly among the single men \n",
      ", had already taken place . The regular and best \n",
      "families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite \n",
      "-- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls . \n",
      "Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did \n",
      "; and she regretted that her father's known habits would \n",
      "be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish \n",
      ". The Coles were very respectable in their way , \n",
      "but they ought to be taught that it was not \n",
      "for them to arrange the terms on which the superior \n",
      "families would visit them . This lesson , she very \n",
      "much feared , they would receive only from herself ; \n",
      "she had little hope of Mr. Knightley , none of \n",
      "Mr. Weston . But she had made up her mind \n",
      "how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it \n",
      "appeared , that when the insult came at last , \n",
      "it found her very differently affected . Donwell and Randalls \n",
      "had received their invitation , and none had come for \n",
      "her father and herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's accounting \n",
      "for it with `` I suppose they will not take \n",
      "the liberty with you ; they know you do not \n",
      "dine out , '' was not quite sufficient . She \n",
      "felt that she should like to have had the power \n",
      "of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of \n",
      "the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of \n",
      "those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again \n",
      "and again , she did not know that she might \n",
      "not have been tempted to accept . Harriet was to \n",
      "be there in the evening , and the Bateses . \n",
      "They had been speaking of it as they walked about \n",
      "Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most \n",
      "earnestly lamented her absence . Might not the evening end \n",
      "in a dance ? had been a question of his \n",
      ". The bare possibility of it acted as a farther \n",
      "irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in \n",
      "solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended \n",
      "as a compliment , was but poor comfort . It \n",
      "was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons \n",
      "were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable \n",
      "; for though her first remark , on reading it \n",
      ", was that `` of course it must be declined \n",
      ", '' she so very soon proceeded to ask them \n",
      "what they advised her to do , that their advice \n",
      "for her going was most prompt and successful . She \n",
      "owned that , considering every thing , she was not \n",
      "absolutely without inclination for the party . The Coles expressed \n",
      "themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention \n",
      "in the manner of it -- so much consideration for \n",
      "her father . `` They would have solicited the honour \n",
      "earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a \n",
      "folding-screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce \n",
      "him the more readily to give them the honour of \n",
      "his company . '' Upon the whole , she was \n",
      "very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves \n",
      "how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- \n",
      "how certainly Mrs. Goddard , if not Mrs. Bates , \n",
      "might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his \n",
      "daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near \n",
      "at hand , and spending the whole evening away from \n",
      "him . As for _his_ going , Emma did not \n",
      "wish him to think it possible , the hours would \n",
      "be too late , and the party too numerous . \n",
      "He was soon pretty well resigned . `` I am \n",
      "not fond of dinner-visiting , '' said he -- '' \n",
      "I never was . No more is Emma . Late \n",
      "hours do not agree with us . I am sorry \n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I \n",
      "think it would be much better if they would come \n",
      "in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea \n",
      "with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; \n",
      "which they might do , as our hours are so \n",
      "reasonable , and yet get home without being out in \n",
      "the damp of the evening . The dews of a \n",
      "summer evening are what I would not expose any body \n",
      "to . However , as they are so very desirous \n",
      "to have dear Emma dine with them , and as \n",
      "you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too \n",
      ", to take care of her , I can not \n",
      "wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what \n",
      "it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor \n",
      "windy . '' Then turning to Mrs. Weston , with \n",
      "a look of gentle reproach -- '' Ah ! Miss \n",
      "Taylor , if you had not married , you would \n",
      "have staid at home with me . '' `` Well \n",
      ", sir , '' cried Mr. Weston , `` as \n",
      "I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on \n",
      "me to supply her place , if I can ; \n",
      "and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment \n",
      ", if you wish it . '' But the idea \n",
      "of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , \n",
      "was increasing , not lessening , Mr. Woodhouse 's agitation \n",
      ". The ladies knew better how to allay it . \n",
      "Mr. Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately \n",
      "arranged . With this treatment , Mr. Woodhouse was soon \n",
      "composed enough for talking as usual . `` He should \n",
      "be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a \n",
      "great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write \n",
      "a line , and invite her . James could take \n",
      "the note . But first of all , there must \n",
      "be an answer written to Mrs . Cole . '' \n",
      "`` You will make my excuses , my dear , \n",
      "as civilly as possible . You will say that I \n",
      "am quite an invalid , and go no where , \n",
      "and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with \n",
      "my _compliments_ , of course . But you will do \n",
      "every thing right . I need not tell you what \n",
      "is to be done . We must remember to let \n",
      "James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday \n",
      ". I shall have no fears for you with him \n",
      ". We have never been there above once since the \n",
      "new approach was made ; but still I have no \n",
      "doubt that James will take you very safely . And \n",
      "when you get there , you must tell him at \n",
      "what time you would have him come for you again \n",
      "; and you had better name an early hour . \n",
      "You will not like staying late . You will get \n",
      "very tired when tea is over . '' `` But \n",
      "you would not wish me to come away before I \n",
      "am tired , papa ? '' `` Oh ! no \n",
      ", my love ; but you will soon be tired \n",
      ". There will be a great many people talking at \n",
      "once . You will not like the noise . '' \n",
      "`` But , my dear sir , '' cried Mr. \n",
      "Weston , `` if Emma comes away early , it \n",
      "will be breaking up the party . '' `` And \n",
      "no great harm if it does , '' said Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse . `` The sooner every party breaks up , \n",
      "the better . '' `` But you do not consider \n",
      "how it may appear to the Coles . Emma 's \n",
      "going away directly after tea might be giving offence . \n",
      "They are good-natured people , and think little of their \n",
      "own claims ; but still they must feel that any \n",
      "body 's hurrying away is no great compliment ; and \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse 's doing it would be more thought of \n",
      "than any other person 's in the room . You \n",
      "would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , \n",
      "I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort \n",
      "of people as ever lived , and who have been \n",
      "your neighbours these _ten_ years . '' `` No , \n",
      "upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; \n",
      "I am much obliged to you for reminding me . \n",
      "I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any \n",
      "pain . I know what worthy people they are . \n",
      "Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor \n",
      ". You would not think it to look at him \n",
      ", but he is bilious -- Mr. Cole is very \n",
      "bilious . No , I would not be the means \n",
      "of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , \n",
      "we must consider this . I am sure , rather \n",
      "than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole \n",
      ", you would stay a little longer than you might \n",
      "wish . You will not regard being tired . You \n",
      "will be perfectly safe , you know , among your \n",
      "friends . '' `` Oh yes , papa . I \n",
      "have no fears at all for myself ; and I \n",
      "should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. \n",
      "Weston , but on your account . I am only \n",
      "afraid of your sitting up for me . I am \n",
      "not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. \n",
      "Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but \n",
      "when she is gone home , I am afraid you \n",
      "will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going \n",
      "to bed at your usual time -- and the idea \n",
      "of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must \n",
      "promise me not to sit up . '' He did \n",
      ", on the condition of some promises on her side \n",
      ": such as that , if she came home cold \n",
      ", she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; \n",
      "if hungry , that she would take something to eat \n",
      "; that her own maid should sit up for her \n",
      "; and that Serle and the butler should see that \n",
      "every thing were safe in the house , as usual \n",
      ". CHAPTER VIII Frank Churchill came back again ; and \n",
      "if he kept his father's dinner waiting , it was \n",
      "not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs. Weston was too \n",
      "anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse , \n",
      "to betray any imperfection which could be concealed . He \n",
      "came back , had had his hair cut , and \n",
      "laughed at himself with a very good grace , but \n",
      "without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had \n",
      "done . He had no reason to wish his hair \n",
      "longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no \n",
      "reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his \n",
      "spirits . He was quite as undaunted and as lively \n",
      "as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma \n",
      "thus moralised to herself : -- '' I do not \n",
      "know whether it ought to be so , but certainly \n",
      "silly things do cease to be silly if they are \n",
      "done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness \n",
      "is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly. \n",
      "-- It depends upon the character of those who handle \n",
      "it . Mr. Knightley , he is _not_ a trifling \n",
      ", silly young man . If he were , he \n",
      "would have done this differently . He would either have \n",
      "gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it \n",
      ". There would have been either the ostentation of a \n",
      "coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak \n",
      "to defend its own vanities. -- No , I am \n",
      "perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . \n",
      "'' With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him \n",
      "again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; \n",
      "of judging of his general manners , and by inference \n",
      ", of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; \n",
      "of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her \n",
      "to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying \n",
      "what the observations of all those might be , who \n",
      "were now seeing them together for the first time . \n",
      "She meant to be very happy , in spite of \n",
      "the scene being laid at Mr. Cole 's ; and \n",
      "without being able to forget that among the failings of \n",
      "Mr. Elton , even in the days of his favour \n",
      ", none had disturbed her more than his propensity to \n",
      "dine with Mr. Cole . Her father 's comfort was \n",
      "amply secured , Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard \n",
      "being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty \n",
      ", before she left the house , was to pay \n",
      "her respects to them as they sat together after dinner \n",
      "; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty \n",
      "of her dress , to make the two ladies all \n",
      "the amends in her power , by helping them to \n",
      "large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , \n",
      "for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might \n",
      "have obliged them to practise during the meal. -- She \n",
      "had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished \n",
      "she could know that they had been allowed to eat \n",
      "it . She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole 's \n",
      "door ; and was pleased to see that it was \n",
      "Mr. Knightley 's ; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses \n",
      ", having little spare money and a great deal of \n",
      "health , activity , and independence , was too apt \n",
      ", in Emma 's opinion , to get about as \n",
      "he could , and not use his carriage so often \n",
      "as became the owner of Donwell Abbey . She had \n",
      "an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from \n",
      "her heart , for he stopped to hand her out \n",
      ". `` This is coming as you should do , \n",
      "'' said she ; `` like a gentleman. -- I \n",
      "am quite glad to see you . '' He thanked \n",
      "her , observing , `` How lucky that we should \n",
      "arrive at the same moment ! for , if we \n",
      "had met first in the drawing-room , I doubt whether \n",
      "you would have discerned me to be more of a \n",
      "gentleman than usual. -- You might not have distinguished how \n",
      "I came , by my look or manner . '' \n",
      "`` Yes I should , I am sure I should \n",
      ". There is always a look of consciousness or bustle \n",
      "when people come in a way which they know to \n",
      "be beneath them . You think you carry it off \n",
      "very well , I dare say , but with you \n",
      "it is a sort of bravado , an air of \n",
      "affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet \n",
      "you under those circumstances . _Now_ you have nothing to \n",
      "try for . You are not afraid of being supposed \n",
      "ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than \n",
      "any body else . _Now_ I shall really be very \n",
      "happy to walk into the same room with you . \n",
      "'' `` Nonsensical girl ! '' was his reply , \n",
      "but not at all in anger . Emma had as \n",
      "much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the \n",
      "party as with Mr. Knightley . She was received with \n",
      "a cordial respect which could not but please , and \n",
      "given all the consequence she could wish for . When \n",
      "the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , \n",
      "the strongest of admiration were for her , from both \n",
      "husband and wife ; the son approached her with a \n",
      "cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , \n",
      "and at dinner she found him seated by her -- \n",
      "and , as she firmly believed , not without some \n",
      "dexterity on his side . The party was rather large \n",
      ", as it included one other family , a proper \n",
      "unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage \n",
      "of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part \n",
      "of Mr. Cox 's family , the lawyer of Highbury \n",
      ". The less worthy females were to come in the \n",
      "evening , with Miss Bates , Miss Fairfax , and \n",
      "Miss Smith ; but already , at dinner , they \n",
      "were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be \n",
      "general ; and , while politics and Mr. Elton were \n",
      "talked over , Emma could fairly surrender all her attention \n",
      "to the pleasantness of her neighbour . The first remote \n",
      "sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , \n",
      "was the name of Jane Fairfax . Mrs. Cole seemed \n",
      "to be relating something of her that was expected to \n",
      "be very interesting . She listened , and found it \n",
      "well worth listening to . That very dear part of \n",
      "Emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply . \n",
      "Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on \n",
      "Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the \n",
      "room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte \n",
      "-- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand \n",
      ", but a large-sized square pianoforte ; and the substance \n",
      "of the story , the end of all the dialogue \n",
      "which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations \n",
      "on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates 's \n",
      ", was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood \n",
      "'s the day before , to the great astonishment of \n",
      "both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at \n",
      "first , by Miss Bates 's account , Jane herself \n",
      "was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think \n",
      "who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , \n",
      "they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from \n",
      "only one quarter ; -- of course it must be \n",
      "from Colonel Campbell . `` One can suppose nothing else \n",
      ", '' added Mrs. Cole , `` and I was \n",
      "only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt \n",
      ". But Jane , it seems , had a letter \n",
      "from them very lately , and not a word was \n",
      "said about it . She knows their ways best ; \n",
      "but I should not consider their silence as any reason \n",
      "for their not meaning to make the present . They \n",
      "might chuse to surprize her . '' Mrs. Cole had \n",
      "many to agree with her ; every body who spoke \n",
      "on the subject was equally convinced that it must come \n",
      "from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a \n",
      "present had been made ; and there were enough ready \n",
      "to speak to allow Emma to think her own way \n",
      ", and still listen to Mrs. Cole . `` I \n",
      "declare , I do not know when I have heard \n",
      "any thing that has given me more satisfaction ! -- \n",
      "It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , \n",
      "who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument \n",
      ". It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how \n",
      "many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown \n",
      "away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , \n",
      "to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I \n",
      "was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to \n",
      "look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room , \n",
      "while I do not know one note from another , \n",
      "and our little girls , who are but just beginning \n",
      ", perhaps may never make any thing of it ; \n",
      "and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress \n",
      "of music , has not any thing of the nature \n",
      "of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet \n",
      "in the world , to amuse herself with. -- I \n",
      "was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and \n",
      "he quite agreed with me ; only he is so \n",
      "particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging \n",
      "himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our \n",
      "good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it \n",
      "to a better use than we can ; and that \n",
      "really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- \n",
      "or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed \n",
      "of it. -- We are in great hopes that Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening \n",
      ". '' Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and \n",
      "finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any \n",
      "communication of Mrs. Cole 's , turned to Frank Churchill \n",
      ". `` Why do you smile ? '' said she \n",
      ". `` Nay , why do you ? '' `` \n",
      "Me ! -- I suppose I smile for pleasure at \n",
      "Colonel Campbell 's being so rich and so liberal. -- \n",
      "It is a handsome present . '' `` Very . \n",
      "'' `` I rather wonder that it was never made \n",
      "before . '' `` Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been \n",

      "a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too \n",
      "large for Mrs. Bates 's house . '' `` You \n",

      "than I deserve . I smile because you smile , \n",
      "and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; \n",
      "but at present I do not see what there is \n",
      "to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person \n",
      ", who can be ? '' `` What do you \n",
      "say to Mrs . Dixon ? '' `` Mrs. Dixon \n",
      "! very true indeed . I had not thought of \n",
      "Mrs. Dixon . She must know as well as her \n",
      "father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and \n",
      "perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the \n",
      "surprize , is more like a young woman 's scheme \n",
      "than an elderly man 's . It is Mrs. Dixon \n",
      ", I dare say . I told you that your \n",
      "suspicions would guide mine . '' `` If so , \n",
      "you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_ . Dixon \n",
      "in them . '' `` Mr . Dixon. -- Very \n",
      "well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must \n",
      "be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . \n",
      "We were speaking the other day , you know , \n",
      "of his being so warm an admirer of her performance \n",
      ". '' `` Yes , and what you told me \n",
      "on that head , confirmed an idea which I had \n",
      "entertained before. -- I do not mean to reflect upon \n",
      "the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax \n",
      ", but I can not help suspecting either that , \n",
      "after making his proposals to her friend , he had \n",
      "the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or \n",
      "that he became conscious of a little attachment on her \n",
      "side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly \n",
      "the right ; but I am sure there must be \n",
      "a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury \n",
      "instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here \n",
      ", she must be leading a life of privation and \n",
      "penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . \n",
      "As to the pretence of trying her native air , \n",
      "I look upon that as a mere excuse. -- In \n",
      "the summer it might have passed ; but what can \n",
      "any body 's native air do for them in the \n",
      "months of January , February , and March ? Good \n",
      "fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose \n",
      "in most cases of delicate health , and I dare \n",
      "say in her 's . I do not require you \n",
      "to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so \n",
      "noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly \n",
      "tell you what they are . '' `` And , \n",
      "upon my word , they have an air of great \n",
      "probability . Mr. Dixon 's preference of her music to \n",
      "her friend 's , I can answer for being very \n",
      "decided . '' `` And then , he saved her \n",
      "life . Did you ever hear of that ? -- \n",
      "A water party ; and by some accident she was \n",
      "falling overboard . He caught her . '' `` He \n",
      "did . I was there -- one of the party \n",
      ". '' `` Were you really ? -- Well ! \n",
      "-- But you observed nothing of course , for it \n",
      "seems to be a new idea to you. -- If \n",
      "I had been there , I think I should have \n",
      "made some discoveries . '' `` I dare say you \n",
      "would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing \n",
      "but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed \n",
      "from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her. -- \n",
      "It was the work of a moment . And though \n",
      "the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much \n",
      "more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an \n",
      "hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet \n",
      "that was too general a sensation for any thing of \n",
      "peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean \n",
      "to say , however , that you might not have \n",
      "made discoveries . '' The conversation was here interrupted . \n",
      "They were called on to share in the awkwardness of \n",
      "a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged \n",
      "to be as formal and as orderly as the others \n",
      "; but when the table was again safely covered , \n",
      "when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and \n",
      "occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said , \n",
      "'' The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me \n",
      ". I wanted to know a little more , and \n",
      "this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , \n",
      "we shall soon hear that it is a present from \n",
      "Mr. and Mrs . Dixon . '' `` And if \n",
      "the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we \n",
      "must conclude it to come from the Campbells . '' \n",
      "`` No , I am sure it is not from \n",
      "the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from \n",
      "the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at \n",
      "first . She would not have been puzzled , had \n",
      "she dared fix on them . I may not have \n",
      "convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself \n",
      "that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business . \n",
      "'' `` Indeed you injure me if you suppose me \n",
      "unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them \n",
      "entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied \n",
      "that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it \n",
      "only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most \n",
      "natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned \n",
      "Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that \n",
      "it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . \n",
      "And now I can see it in no other light \n",
      "than as an offering of love . '' There was \n",
      "no occasion to press the matter farther . The conviction \n",
      "seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it \n",
      ". She said no more , other subjects took their \n",
      "turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away \n",
      "; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , \n",
      "and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate \n",
      "of conversation ; a few clever things said , a \n",
      "few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion \n",
      "neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than \n",
      "everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and \n",
      "heavy jokes . The ladies had not been long in \n",
      "the drawing-room , before the other ladies , in their \n",
      "different divisions , arrived . Emma watched the entree of \n",
      "her own particular little friend ; and if she could \n",
      "not exult in her dignity and grace , she could \n",
      "not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner \n",
      ", but could most heartily rejoice in that light , \n",
      "cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations \n",
      "of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of \n",
      "disappointed affection . There she sat -- and who would \n",
      "have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding \n",
      "? To be in company , nicely dressed herself and \n",
      "seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and \n",
      "look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for \n",
      "the happiness of the present hour . Jane Fairfax did \n",
      "look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might \n",
      "have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very \n",
      "glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- \n",
      "yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain \n",
      "-- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of \n",
      "knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . \n",
      "In so large a party it was not necessary that \n",
      "Emma should approach her . She did not wish to \n",
      "speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in \n",
      "the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity \n",
      "or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a \n",
      "distance ; but by the others , the subject was \n",
      "almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of \n",
      "consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of \n",
      "guilt which accompanied the name of `` my excellent friend \n",
      "Colonel Campbell . '' Mrs. Weston , kind-hearted and musical \n",
      ", was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma \n",
      "could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling \n",
      "on the subject ; and having so much to ask \n",
      "and to say as to tone , touch , and \n",
      "pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as \n",
      "little about it as possible , which she plainly read \n",
      "in the fair heroine 's countenance . They were soon \n",
      "joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very \n",
      "first of the early was Frank Churchill . In he \n",
      "walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after \n",
      "paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her \n",
      "niece , made his way directly to the opposite side \n",
      "of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and \n",
      "till he could find a seat by her , would \n",
      "not sit at all . Emma divined what every body \n",
      "present must be thinking . She was his object , \n",
      "and every body must perceive it . She introduced him \n",
      "to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at \n",
      "convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the \n",
      "other . `` He had never seen so lovely a \n",
      "face , and was delighted with her naivete . '' \n",
      "And she , `` Only to be sure it was \n",
      "paying him too great a compliment , but she did \n",
      "think there were some looks a little like Mr . \n",
      "Elton . '' Emma restrained her indignation , and only \n",
      "turned from her in silence . Smiles of intelligence passed \n",
      "between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss \n",
      "Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech \n",
      ". He told her that he had been impatient to \n",
      "leave the dining-room -- hated sitting long -- was always \n",
      "the first to move when he could -- that his \n",
      "father , Mr. Knightley , Mr. Cox , and Mr. \n",
      "Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- \n",
      "that as long as he had staid , however , \n",
      "it had been pleasant enough , as he had found \n",
      "them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men \n",
      "; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought \n",
      "it so abundant in agreeable families -- that Emma began \n",
      "to feel she had been used to despise the place \n",
      "rather too much . She questioned him as to the \n",
      "society in Yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about \n",
      "Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out \n",
      "from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was \n",
      "concerned , there was very little going on , that \n",
      "their visitings were among a range of great families , \n",
      "none very near ; and that even when days were \n",
      "fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even \n",
      "chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits \n",
      "for going ; that they made a point of visiting \n",
      "no fresh person ; and that , though he had \n",
      "his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , \n",
      "without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get \n",
      "away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night . \n",
      "She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that \n",
      "Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please \n",
      "a young man who had more retirement at home than \n",
      "he liked . His importance at Enscombe was very evident \n",
      ". He did not boast , but it naturally betrayed \n",
      "itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his \n",
      "uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and \n",
      "noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting \n",
      "one or two points ) he could _with_ _time_ persuade \n",
      "her to any thing . One of those points on \n",
      "which his influence failed , he then mentioned . He \n",
      "had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been \n",
      "very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but \n",
      "she would not hear of it . This had happened \n",
      "the year before . _Now_ , he said , he \n",
      "was beginning to have no longer the same wish . \n",
      "The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , \n",
      "Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father . \n",
      "`` I have made a most wretched discovery , '' \n",
      "said he , after a short pause. -- '' I \n",
      "have been here a week to-morrow -- half my time \n",
      ". I never knew days fly so fast . A \n",
      "week to-morrow ! -- And I have hardly begun to \n",
      "enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston \n",
      ", and others ! -- I hate the recollection . \n",
      "'' `` Perhaps you may now begin to regret that \n",
      "you spent one whole day , out of so few \n",
      ", in having your hair cut . '' `` No \n",
      ", '' said he , smiling , `` that is \n",
      "no subject of regret at all . I have no \n",
      "pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe \n",
      "myself fit to be seen . '' The rest of \n",
      "the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found \n",
      "herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes \n",
      ", and listen to Mr. Cole . When Mr. Cole \n",
      "had moved away , and her attention could be restored \n",
      "as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across \n",
      "the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly \n",
      "opposite . `` What is the matter ? '' said \n",
      "she . He started . `` Thank you for rousing \n",
      "me , '' he replied . `` I believe I \n",
      "have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has \n",
      "done her hair in so odd a way -- so \n",
      "very odd a way -- that I can not keep \n",
      "my eyes from her . I never saw any thing \n",
      "so outree ! -- Those curls ! -- This must \n",
      "be a fancy of her own . I see nobody \n",
      "else looking like her ! -- I must go and \n",
      "ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall \n",
      "I ? -- Yes , I will -- I declare \n",
      "I will -- and you shall see how she takes \n",
      "it ; -- whether she colours . '' He was \n",
      "gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as \n",
      "to its effect on the young lady , as he \n",
      "had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in \n",
      "front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing \n",
      ". Before he could return to his chair , it \n",
      "was taken by Mrs. Weston . `` This is the \n",
      "luxury of a large party , '' said she : \n",
      "-- '' one can get near every body , and \n",
      "say every thing . My dear Emma , I am \n",
      "longing to talk to you . I have been making \n",
      "discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and \n",
      "I must tell them while the idea is fresh . \n",
      "Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came \n",
      "here ? '' `` How ? -- They were invited \n",
      ", were not they ? '' `` Oh ! yes \n",
      "-- but how they were conveyed hither ? -- the \n",
      "manner of their coming ? '' `` They walked , \n",
      "I conclude . How else could they come ? '' \n",
      "`` Very true. -- Well , a little while ago \n",
      "it occurred to me how very sad it would be \n",
      "to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at \n",
      "night , and cold as the nights are now . \n",
      "And as I looked at her , though I never \n",
      "saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me \n",
      "that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly \n",
      "liable to take cold . Poor girl ! I could \n",
      "not bear the idea of it ; so , as \n",
      "soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and \n",
      "I could get at him , I spoke to him \n",
      "about the carriage . You may guess how readily he \n",
      "came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , \n",
      "I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to \n",
      "assure her that the carriage would be at her service \n",
      "before it took us home ; for I thought it \n",
      "would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul \n",
      "! she was as grateful as possible , you may \n",
      "be sure . ` Nobody was ever so fortunate as \n",
      "herself ! ' -- but with many , many thanks \n",
      "-- ` there was no occasion to trouble us , \n",
      "for Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought , and was to \n",
      "take them home again . ' I was quite surprized \n",
      "; -- very glad , I am sure ; but \n",
      "really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention -- \n",
      "and so thoughtful an attention ! -- the sort of \n",
      "thing that so few men would think of . And \n",
      ", in short , from knowing his usual ways , \n",
      "I am very much inclined to think that it was \n",
      "for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . \n",
      "I do suspect he would not have had a pair \n",
      "of horses for himself , and that it was only \n",
      "as an excuse for assisting them . '' `` Very \n",
      "likely , '' said Emma -- '' nothing more likely \n",
      ". I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley \n",
      "to do the sort of thing -- to do any \n",
      "thing really good-natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent \n",
      ". He is not a gallant man , but he \n",
      "is a very humane one ; and this , considering \n",
      "Jane Fairfax 's ill-health , would appear a case of \n",
      "humanity to him ; -- and for an act of \n",
      "unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix \n",
      "on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he \n",
      "had horses to-day -- for we arrived together ; and \n",
      "I laughed at him about it , but he said \n",
      "not a word that could betray . '' `` Well \n",
      ", '' said Mrs. Weston , smiling , `` you \n",
      "give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in \n",
      "this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates \n",
      "was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , \n",
      "and I have never been able to get it out \n",
      "again . The more I think of it , the \n",
      "more probable it appears . In short , I have \n",
      "made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax . \n",
      "See the consequence of keeping you company ! -- What \n",
      "do you say to it ? '' `` Mr. Knightley \n",
      "and Jane Fairfax ! '' exclaimed Emma . `` Dear \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a \n",
      "thing ? -- Mr . Knightley ! -- Mr . \n",
      "Knightley must not marry ! -- You would not have \n",
      "little Henry cut out from Donwell ? -- Oh ! \n",
      "no , no , Henry must have Donwell . I \n",
      "can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying \n",
      "; and I am sure it is not at all \n",
      "likely . I am amazed that you should think of \n",
      "such a thing . '' `` My dear Emma , \n",
      "I have told you what led me to think of \n",
      "it . I do not want the match -- I \n",
      "do not want to injure dear little Henry -- but \n",
      "the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and \n",
      "if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would \n",
      "not have him refrain on Henry's account , a boy \n",
      "of six years old , who knows nothing of the \n",
      "matter ? '' `` Yes , I would . I \n",
      "could not bear to have Henry supplanted. -- Mr. Knightley \n",
      "marry ! -- No , I have never had such \n",
      "an idea , and I can not adopt it now \n",
      ". And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women \n",
      "! '' `` Nay , she has always been a \n",
      "first favourite with him , as you very well know \n",
      ". '' `` But the imprudence of such a match \n",
      "! '' `` I am not speaking of its prudence \n",
      "; merely its probability . '' `` I see no \n",
      "probability in it , unless you have any better foundation \n",
      "than what you mention . His good-nature , his humanity \n",
      ", as I tell you , would be quite enough \n",
      "to account for the horses . He has a great \n",
      "regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of \n",
      "Jane Fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them \n",
      "attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take \n",
      "to match-making . You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax \n",
      "mistress of the Abbey ! -- Oh ! no , \n",
      "no ; -- every feeling revolts . For his own \n",
      "sake , I would not have him do so mad \n",
      "a thing . '' `` Imprudent , if you please \n",
      "-- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , \n",
      "and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can \n",
      "see nothing unsuitable . '' `` But Mr. Knightley does \n",
      "not want to marry . I am sure he has \n",
      "not the least idea of it . Do not put \n",
      "it into his head . Why should he marry ? \n",
      "-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; \n",
      "with his farm , and his sheep , and his \n",
      "library , and all the parish to manage ; and \n",
      "he is extremely fond of his brother 's children . \n",
      "He has no occasion to marry , either to fill \n",
      "up his time or his heart . '' `` My \n",
      "dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , \n",
      "it is so ; but if he really loves Jane \n",
      "Fairfax -- '' '' Nonsense ! He does not care \n",
      "about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , \n",
      "I am sure he does not . He would do \n",
      "any good to her , or her family ; but \n",
      "-- '' '' Well , '' said Mrs. Weston , \n",
      "laughing , `` perhaps the greatest good he could do \n",
      "them , would be to give Jane such a respectable \n",
      "home . '' `` If it would be good to \n",
      "her , I am sure it would be evil to \n",
      "himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How \n",
      "would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him \n",
      "? -- To have her haunting the Abbey , and \n",
      "thanking him all day long for his great kindness in \n",
      "marrying Jane ? -- ` So very kind and obliging \n",
      "! -- But he always had been such a very \n",
      "kind neighbour ! ' And then fly off , through \n",
      "half a sentence , to her mother 's old petticoat \n",
      ". ` Not that it was such a very old \n",
      "petticoat either -- for still it would last a great \n",
      "while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say \n",
      "that their petticoats were all very strong . ' '' \n",
      "`` For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her \n",
      ". You divert me against my conscience . And , \n",
      "upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley \n",
      "would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things \n",
      "do not irritate him . She might talk on ; \n",
      "and if he wanted to say any thing himself , \n",
      "he would only talk louder , and drown her voice \n",
      ". But the question is not , whether it would \n",
      "be a bad connexion for him , but whether he \n",
      "wishes it ; and I think he does . I \n",
      "have heard him speak , and so must you , \n",
      "so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he \n",
      "takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- \n",
      "his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! \n",
      "I have heard him express himself so warmly on those \n",
      "points ! -- Such an admirer of her performance on \n",
      "the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have \n",
      "heard him say that he could listen to her for \n",
      "ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one \n",
      "idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has \n",
      "been sent here by somebody -- though we have all \n",
      "been so well satisfied to consider it a present from \n",
      "the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley \n",
      "? I can not help suspecting him . I think \n",
      "he is just the person to do it , even \n",
      "without being in love . '' `` Then it can \n",
      "be no argument to prove that he is in love \n",
      ". But I do not think it is at all \n",
      "a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley \n",
      "does nothing mysteriously . '' `` I have heard him \n",
      "lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I \n",
      "should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common \n",
      "course of things , occur to him . '' `` \n",
      "Very well ; and if he had intended to give \n",
      "her one , he would have told her so . \n",
      "'' `` There might be scruples of delicacy , my \n",
      "dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that \n",
      "it comes from him . I am sure he was \n",
      "particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at \n",
      "dinner . '' `` You take up an idea , \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as \n",
      "you have many a time reproached me with doing . \n",
      "I see no sign of attachment -- I believe nothing \n",
      "of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me \n",
      "that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax \n",
      ". '' They combated the point some time longer in \n",
      "the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the \n",
      "mind of her friend ; for Mrs. Weston was the \n",
      "most used of the two to yield ; till a \n",
      "little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was \n",
      "over , and the instrument in preparation ; -- and \n",
      "at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it . \n",
      "Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of \n",
      "her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing \n",
      "nothing , except that he had found a seat by \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his \n",
      "very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect \n",
      ", it suited Emma best to lead , she gave \n",
      "a very proper compliance . She knew the limitations of \n",
      "her own powers too well to attempt more than she \n",
      "could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor \n",
      "spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , \n",
      "and could accompany her own voice well . One accompaniment \n",
      "to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a \n",
      "second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill . \n",
      "Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the \n",
      "song , and every thing usual followed . He was \n",
      "accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect \n",
      "knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and \n",
      "that he knew nothing of the matter , and had \n",
      "no voice at all , roundly asserted . They sang \n",
      "together once more ; and Emma would then resign her \n",
      "place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal \n",
      "and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from \n",
      "herself , was infinitely superior to her own . With \n",
      "mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance \n",
      "from the numbers round the instrument , to listen . \n",
      "Frank Churchill sang again . They had sung together once \n",
      "or twice , it appeared , at Weymouth . But \n",
      "the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive , \n",
      "soon drew away half Emma 's mind ; and she \n",
      "fell into a train of thinking on the subject of \n",
      "Mrs. Weston 's suspicions , to which the sweet sounds \n",
      "of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions . Her \n",
      "objections to Mr. Knightley 's marrying did not in the \n",
      "least subside . She could see nothing but evil in \n",
      "it . It would be a great disappointment to Mr. \n",
      "John Knightley ; consequently to Isabella . A real injury \n",
      "to the children -- a most mortifying change , and \n",
      "material loss to them all ; -- a very great \n",
      "deduction from her father 's daily comfort -- and , \n",
      "as to herself , she could not at all endure \n",
      "the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey . A \n",
      "Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to ! \n",
      "-- No -- Mr . Knightley must never marry . \n",
      "Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell . Presently \n",
      "Mr. Knightley looked back , and came and sat down \n",
      "by her . They talked at first only of the \n",
      "performance . His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet \n",
      "she thought , but for Mrs. Weston , it would \n",
      "not have struck her . As a sort of touchstone \n",
      ", however , she began to speak of his kindness \n",
      "in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his \n",
      "answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short \n",
      ", she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to \n",
      "dwell on any kindness of his own . `` I \n",
      "often feel concern , '' said she , `` that \n",
      "I dare not make our carriage more useful on such \n",
      "occasions . It is not that I am without the \n",
      "wish ; but you know how impossible my father would \n",
      "deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose \n",
      ". '' `` Quite out of the question , quite \n",
      "out of the question , '' he replied ; -- \n",
      "'' but you must often wish it , I am \n",
      "sure . '' And he smiled with such seeming pleasure \n",
      "at the conviction , that she must proceed another step \n",
      ". `` This present from the Campbells , '' said \n",
      "she -- '' this pianoforte is very kindly given . \n",
      "'' `` Yes , '' he replied , and without \n",
      "the smallest apparent embarrassment. -- '' But they would have \n",
      "done better had they given her notice of it . \n",
      "Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced \n",
      ", and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should \n",
      "have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell . '' From \n",
      "that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that \n",
      "Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument \n",
      ". But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment \n",
      "-- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a \n",
      "little longer doubtful . Towards the end of Jane 's \n",
      "second song , her voice grew thick . `` That \n",
      "will do , '' said he , when it was \n",
      "finished , thinking aloud -- '' you have sung quite \n",
      "enough for one evening -- now be quiet . '' \n",
      "Another song , however , was soon begged for . \n",
      "`` One more ; -- they would not fatigue Miss \n",
      "Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for \n",
      "one more . '' And Frank Churchill was heard to \n",
      "say , `` I think you could manage this without \n",
      "effort ; the first part is so very trifling . \n",
      "The strength of the song falls on the second . \n",
      "'' Mr. Knightley grew angry . `` That fellow , \n",
      "'' said he , indignantly , `` thinks of nothing \n",
      "but shewing off his own voice . This must not \n",
      "be . '' And touching Miss Bates , who at \n",
      "that moment passed near -- '' Miss Bates , are \n",
      "you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse \n",
      "in this manner ? Go , and interfere . They \n",
      "have no mercy on her . '' Miss Bates , \n",
      "in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay \n",
      "even to be grateful , before she stept forward and \n",
      "put an end to all farther singing . Here ceased \n",
      "the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse \n",
      "and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; \n",
      "but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of \n",
      "dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so \n",
      "effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole , that every \n",
      "thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space \n",
      ". Mrs. Weston , capital in her country-dances , was \n",
      "seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank \n",
      "Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma \n",
      ", had secured her hand , and led her up \n",
      "to the top . While waiting till the other young \n",
      "people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , \n",
      "in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her \n",
      "voice and her taste , to look about , and \n",
      "see what became of Mr. Knightley . This would be \n",
      "a trial . He was no dancer in general . \n",
      "If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane \n",
      "Fairfax now , it might augur something . There was \n",
      "no immediate appearance . No ; he was talking to \n",
      "Mrs. Cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane \n",
      "was asked by somebody else , and he was still \n",
      "talking to Mrs. Cole . Emma had no longer an \n",
      "alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; \n",
      "and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and \n",
      "enjoyment . Not more than five couple could be mustered \n",
      "; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made \n",
      "it very delightful , and she found herself well matched \n",
      "in a partner . They were a couple worth looking \n",
      "at . Two dances , unfortunately , were all that \n",
      "could be allowed . It was growing late , and \n",
      "Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her \n",
      "mother 's account . After some attempts , therefore , \n",
      "to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged \n",
      "to thank Mrs. Weston , look sorrowful , and have \n",
      "done . `` Perhaps it is as well , '' \n",
      "said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her \n",
      "carriage . `` I must have asked Miss Fairfax , \n",
      "and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me \n",
      ", after your 's . '' CHAPTER IX Emma did \n",
      "not repent her condescension in going to the Coles . \n",
      "The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day \n",
      "; and all that she might be supposed to have \n",
      "lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be \n",
      "amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must \n",
      "have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved \n",
      "to be made happy ! -- And left a name \n",
      "behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect \n",
      "happiness , even in memory , is not common ; \n",
      "and there were two points on which she was not \n",
      "quite easy . She doubted whether she had not transgressed \n",
      "the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her \n",
      "suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill . \n",
      "It was hardly right ; but it had been so \n",
      "strong an idea , that it would escape her , \n",
      "and his submission to all that she told , was \n",
      "a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult \n",
      "for her to be quite certain that she ought to \n",
      "have held her tongue . The other circumstance of regret \n",
      "related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had \n",
      "no doubt . She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the \n",
      "inferiority of her own playing and singing . She did \n",
      "most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- \n",
      "and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a \n",
      "half . She was then interrupted by Harriet 's coming \n",
      "in ; and if Harriet's praise could have satisfied her \n",
      ", she might soon have been comforted . `` Oh \n",
      "! if I could but play as well as you \n",
      "and Miss Fairfax ! '' `` Do n't class us \n",
      "together , Harriet . My playing is no more like \n",
      "her 's , than a lamp is like sunshine . \n",
      "'' `` Oh ! dear -- I think you play \n",
      "the best of the two . I think you play \n",
      "quite as well as she does . I am sure \n",
      "I had much rather hear you . Every body last \n",
      "night said how well you played . '' `` Those \n",
      "who knew any thing about it , must have felt \n",
      "the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that \n",
      "my playing is just good enough to be praised , \n",
      "but Jane Fairfax 's is much beyond it . '' \n",
      "`` Well , I always shall think that you play \n",
      "quite as well as she does , or that if \n",
      "there is any difference nobody would ever find it out \n",
      ". Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; \n",
      "and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your \n",
      "taste , and that he valued taste much more than \n",
      "execution . '' `` Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has \n",
      "them both , Harriet . '' `` Are you sure \n",
      "? I saw she had execution , but I did \n",
      "not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about \n",
      "it . And I hate Italian singing. -- There is \n",
      "no understanding a word of it . Besides , if \n",
      "she does play so very well , you know , \n",
      "it is no more than she is obliged to do \n",
      ", because she will have to teach . The Coxes \n",
      "were wondering last night whether she would get into any \n",
      "great family . How did you think the Coxes looked \n",
      "? '' `` Just as they always do -- very \n",
      "vulgar . '' `` They told me something , '' \n",
      "said Harriet rather hesitatingly ; '' but it is nothing \n",
      "of any consequence . '' Emma was obliged to ask \n",
      "what they had told her , though fearful of its \n",
      "producing Mr. Elton . `` They told me -- that \n",
      "Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday . '' `` \n",
      "Oh ! '' `` He came to their father upon \n",
      "some business , and he asked him to stay to \n",
      "dinner . '' `` Oh ! '' `` They talked \n",
      "a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox . \n",
      "I do not know what she meant , but she \n",
      "asked me if I thought I should go and stay \n",
      "there again next summer . '' `` She meant to \n",
      "be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox \n",
      "should be . '' `` She said he was very \n",
      "agreeable the day he dined there . He sat by \n",
      "her at dinner . Miss Nash thinks either of the \n",
      "Coxes would be very glad to marry him . '' \n",
      "`` Very likely. -- I think they are , without \n",
      "exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . '' \n",
      "Harriet had business at Ford's. -- Emma thought it most \n",
      "prudent to go with her . Another accidental meeting with \n",
      "the Martins was possible , and in her present state \n",
      ", would be dangerous . Harriet , tempted by every \n",
      "thing and swayed by half a word , was always \n",
      "very long at a purchase ; and while she was \n",
      "still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma \n",
      "went to the door for amusement. -- Much could not \n",
      "be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part \n",
      "of Highbury ; -- Mr. Perry walking hastily by , \n",
      "Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door , \n",
      "Mr. Cole 's carriage-horses returning from exercise , or a \n",
      "stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest \n",
      "objects she could presume to expect ; and when her \n",
      "eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , \n",
      "a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her \n",
      "full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone \n",
      ", and a string of dawdling children round the baker \n",
      "'s little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she \n",
      "had no reason to complain , and was amused enough \n",
      "; quite enough still to stand at the door . \n",
      "A mind lively and at ease , can do with \n",
      "seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not \n",
      "answer . She looked down the Randalls road . The \n",
      "scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs. Weston and \n",
      "her son-in-law ; they were walking into Highbury ; -- \n",
      "to Hartfield of course . They were stopping , however \n",
      ", in the first place at Mrs. Bates 's ; \n",
      "whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford 's \n",
      "; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught \n",
      "their eye. -- Immediately they crossed the road and came \n",
      "forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement \n",
      "seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting . \n",
      "Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call \n",
      "on the Bateses , in order to hear the new \n",
      "instrument . `` For my companion tells me , '' \n",
      "said she , `` that I absolutely promised Miss Bates \n",
      "last night , that I would come this morning . \n",
      "I was not aware of it myself . I did \n",
      "not know that I had fixed a day , but \n",
      "as he says I did , I am going now \n",
      ". '' `` And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit \n",
      ", I may be allowed , I hope , '' \n",
      "said Frank Churchill , `` to join your party and \n",
      "wait for her at Hartfield -- if you are going \n",
      "home . '' Mrs. Weston was disappointed . `` I \n",
      "thought you meant to go with me . They would \n",
      "be very much pleased . '' `` Me ! I \n",
      "should be quite in the way . But , perhaps \n",
      "-- I may be equally in the way here . \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me \n",
      ". My aunt always sends me off when she is \n",
      "shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; \n",
      "and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say \n",
      "the same . What am I to do ? '' \n",
      "`` I am here on no business of my own \n",
      ", '' said Emma ; `` I am only waiting \n",
      "for my friend . She will probably have soon done \n",
      ", and then we shall go home . But you \n",
      "had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument \n",
      ". '' `` Well -- if you advise it. -- \n",
      "But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should \n",
      "have employed a careless friend , and if it should \n",
      "prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I \n",
      "say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston \n",
      ". She might do very well by herself . A \n",
      "disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but \n",
      "I am the wretchedest being in the world at a \n",
      "civil falsehood . '' `` I do not believe any \n",
      "such thing , '' replied Emma. -- '' I am \n",
      "persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours \n",
      ", when it is necessary ; but there is no \n",
      "reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . Quite otherwise \n",
      "indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax 's opinion last \n",
      "night . '' `` Do come with me , '' \n",
      "said Mrs. Weston , `` if it be not very \n",
      "disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long \n",
      ". We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will \n",
      "follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to \n",
      "call with me . It will be felt so great \n",
      "an attention ! and I always thought you meant it \n",
      ". '' He could say no more ; and with \n",
      "the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with \n",
      "Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door . Emma watched \n",
      "them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting \n",
      "counter , -- trying , with all the force of \n",
      "her own mind , to convince her that if she \n",
      "wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look \n",

      "even to the destination of the parcel . `` Should \n",
      "I send it to Mrs. Goddard 's , ma'am ? \n",
      "'' asked Mrs . Ford. -- '' Yes -- no \n",
      "-- yes , to Mrs. Goddard 's . Only my \n",

      ". But I shall want the ribbon directly -- so \n",
      "it had better go to Hartfield -- at least the \n",
      "ribbon . You could make it into two parcels , \n",
      "Mrs. Ford , could not you ? '' `` It \n",

      "Ford the trouble of two parcels . '' `` No \n",

      "-- But , said I , I shall be more \n",
      "sure of succeeding if one of you will go with \n",
      "me. -- ` Oh , ' said he , ` \n",

      "job ; ' -- For , would you believe it \n",
      ", Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the \n",
      "most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the \n",
      "rivet of my mother 's spectacles. -- The rivet came \n",
      "out , you know , this morning. -- So very \n",
      "obliging ! -- For my mother had no use of \n",

      "your mistress 's spectacles out . Then the baked apples \n",

      "; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , \n",
      "the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people \n",
      "say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a \n",
      "very rude answer , but we have never known any \n",

      "him in the street . Not that I had any \n",
      "doubt before -- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse \n",

      "Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston \n",
      ", you have prevailed , I hope , and these \n",

      "the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates \n",
      "than , '' How do you do , Mrs. Ford \n",
      "? I beg your pardon . I did not see \n",
      "you before . I hear you have a charming collection \n",
      "of new ribbons from town . Jane came back delighted \n",
      "yesterday . Thank ye , the gloves do very well \n",
      "-- only a little too large about the wrist ; \n",
      "but Jane is taking them in . '' `` What \n",
      "was I talking of ? '' said she , beginning \n",
      "again when they were all in the street . Emma \n",
      "wondered on what , of all the medley , she \n",
      "would fix . `` I declare I can not recollect \n",
      "what I was talking of. -- Oh ! my mother \n",
      "'s spectacles . So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill \n",
      "! ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I \n",
      "do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like \n",
      "a job of this kind excessively . ' -- Which \n",
      "you know shewed him to be so very . . \n",
      ". . Indeed I must say that , much as \n",
      "I had heard of him before and much as I \n",
      "had expected , he very far exceeds any thing . \n",
      ". . . I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston \n",
      ", most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest \n",
      "parent could . . . . ` Oh ! ' \n",
      "said he , ` I can fasten the rivet . \n",
      "I like a job of that sort excessively . ' \n",
      "I never shall forget his manner . And when I \n",
      "brought out the baked apples from the closet , and \n",
      "hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to \n",
      "take some , ` Oh ! ' said he directly \n",
      ", ` there is nothing in the way of fruit \n",
      "half so good , and these are the finest-looking home-baked \n",
      "apples I ever saw in my life . ' That \n",
      ", you know , was so very . . . \n",
      ". And I am sure , by his manner , \n",
      "it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful \n",
      "apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- \n",
      "only we do not have them baked more than twice \n",
      ", and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them \n",
      "done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so \n",
      "good as not to mention it . The apples themselves \n",
      "are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a \n",
      "doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr. Knightley \n",
      "'s most liberal supply . He sends us a sack \n",
      "every year ; and certainly there never was such a \n",
      "keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I \n",
      "believe there is two of them . My mother says \n",
      "the orchard was always famous in her younger days . \n",
      "But I was really quite shocked the other day -- \n",
      "for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was \n",
      "eating these apples , and we talked about them and \n",
      "said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked \n",
      "whether we were not got to the end of our \n",
      "stock . ` I am sure you must be , \n",
      "' said he , ` and I will send you \n",
      "another supply ; for I have a great many more \n",
      "than I can ever use . William Larkins let me \n",
      "keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I \n",
      "will send you some more , before they get good \n",
      "for nothing . ' So I begged he would not \n",
      "-- for really as to ours being gone , I \n",
      "could not absolutely say that we had a great many \n",
      "left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; \n",
      "but they should be all kept for Jane ; and \n",
      "I could not at all bear that he should be \n",
      "sending us more , so liberal as he had been \n",
      "already ; and Jane said the same . And when \n",
      "he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- \n",
      "No , I should not say quarrelled , for we \n",
      "never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she \n",
      "was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were \n",
      "so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him \n",
      "believe we had a great many left . Oh , \n",
      "said I , my dear , I did say as \n",
      "much as I could . However , the very same \n",
      "evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of \n",
      "apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel \n",
      "at least , and I was very much obliged , \n",
      "and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said \n",
      "every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins \n",
      "is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad \n",
      "to see him . But , however , I found \n",
      "afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all \n",
      "the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he \n",
      "had brought them all -- and now his master had \n",
      "not one left to bake or boil . William did \n",
      "not seem to mind it himself , he was so \n",
      "pleased to think his master had sold so many ; \n",
      "for William , you know , thinks more of his \n",
      "master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges \n",
      ", he said , was quite displeased at their being \n",
      "all sent away . She could not bear that her \n",
      "master should not be able to have another apple-tart this \n",
      "spring . He told Patty this , but bid her \n",
      "not mind it , and be sure not to say \n",
      "any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges \n",
      "_would_ be cross sometimes , and as long as so \n",
      "many sacks were sold , it did not signify who \n",
      "ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , \n",
      "and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not \n",
      "have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the \n",
      "world ! He would be so very . . . \n",
      ". I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge \n",
      "; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before \n",
      "I was aware . '' Miss Bates had just done \n",
      "as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked \n",
      "upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , \n",
      "pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will . \n",
      "`` Pray take care , Mrs. Weston , there is \n",
      "a step at the turning . Pray take care , \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- \n",
      "rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss \n",
      "Smith , pray take care . Miss Woodhouse , I \n",
      "am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your \n",
      "foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning \n",
      ". '' CHAPTER X The appearance of the little sitting-room \n",
      "as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates \n",
      ", deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one \n",
      "side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a \n",
      "table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles \n",
      ", and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to \n",
      "them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he \n",
      "was , however , the young man was yet able \n",
      "to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again \n",
      ". `` This is a pleasure , '' said he \n",
      ", in rather a low voice , `` coming at \n",
      "least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You \n",
      "find me trying to be useful ; tell me if \n",
      "you think I shall succeed . '' `` What ! \n",
      "'' said Mrs. Weston , `` have not you finished \n",
      "it yet ? you would not earn a very good \n",
      "livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . '' \n",
      "`` I have not been working uninterruptedly , '' he \n",
      "replied , `` I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in \n",
      "trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was \n",
      "not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , \n",
      "I believe . You see we have been wedging one \n",
      "leg with paper . This was very kind of you \n",
      "to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid \n",
      "you would be hurrying home . '' He contrived that \n",
      "she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently \n",
      "employed in looking out the best baked apple for her \n",
      ", and trying to make her help or advise him \n",
      "in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready \n",
      "to sit down to the pianoforte again . That she \n",
      "was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise \n",
      "from the state of her nerves ; she had not \n",
      "yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without \n",
      "emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of \n",
      "performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings \n",
      ", whatever their origin , and could not but resolve \n",
      "never to expose them to her neighbour again . At \n",
      "last Jane began , and though the first bars were \n",
      "feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually \n",
      "done full justice to . Mrs. Weston had been delighted \n",
      "before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her \n",
      "in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with \n",
      "every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of \n",
      "the highest promise . `` Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ \n",
      ", '' said Frank Churchill , with a smile at \n",
      "Emma , `` the person has not chosen ill . \n",
      "I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell 's taste \n",
      "at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes \n",
      "I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ \n",
      "_party_ would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss \n",
      "Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute \n",
      "directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not \n",
      "you think so ? '' Jane did not look round \n",
      ". She was not obliged to hear . Mrs. Weston \n",
      "had been speaking to her at the same moment . \n",
      "`` It is not fair , '' said Emma , \n",
      "in a whisper ; `` mine was a random guess \n",
      ". Do not distress her . '' He shook his \n",
      "head with a smile , and looked as if he \n",
      "had very little doubt and very little mercy . Soon \n",
      "afterwards he began again , '' How much your friends \n",
      "in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion \n",
      ", Miss Fairfax . I dare say they often think \n",
      "of you , and wonder which will be the day \n",
      ", the precise day of the instrument's coming to hand \n",
      ". Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to \n",
      "be going forward just at this time ? -- Do \n",
      "you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate \n",
      "commission from him , or that he may have sent \n",
      "only a general direction , an order indefinite as to \n",
      "time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? '' \n",
      "He paused . She could not but hear ; she \n",
      "could not avoid answering , '' Till I have a \n",
      "letter from Colonel Campbell , '' said she , in \n",
      "a voice of forced calmness , `` I can imagine \n",
      "nothing with any confidence . It must be all conjecture \n",
      ". '' `` Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures \n",
      "right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . I wish \n",
      "I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet \n",
      "quite firm . What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse \n",
      ", when hard at work , if one talks at \n",
      "all ; -- your real workmen , I suppose , \n",
      "hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we \n",
      "get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something \n",
      "about conjecturing . There , it is done . I \n",
      "have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates \n",
      ", ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the \n",
      "present . '' He was very warmly thanked both by \n",
      "mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the \n",
      "latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , \n",
      "to play something more . `` If you are very \n",
      "kind , '' said he , `` it will be \n",
      "one of the waltzes we danced last night ; -- \n",
      "let me live them over again . You did not \n",
      "enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the \n",
      "whole time . I believe you were glad we danced \n",
      "no longer ; but I would have given worlds -- \n",
      "all the worlds one ever has to give -- for \n",
      "another half-hour . '' She played . `` What felicity \n",
      "it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made \n",
      "one happy ! -- If I mistake not that was \n",
      "danced at Weymouth . '' She looked up at him \n",
      "for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something \n",
      "else . He took some music from a chair near \n",
      "the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said , \n",
      "'' Here is something quite new to me . Do \n",
      "you know it ? -- Cramer. -- And here are \n",
      "a new set of Irish melodies . That , from \n",
      "such a quarter , one might expect . This was \n",
      "all sent with the instrument . Very thoughtful of Colonel \n",
      "Campbell , was not it ? -- He knew Miss \n",
      "Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that \n",
      "part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to \n",
      "have been so thoroughly from the heart . Nothing hastily \n",
      "done ; nothing incomplete . True affection only could have \n",
      "prompted it . '' Emma wished he would be less \n",
      "pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and \n",
      "when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught \n",
      "the remains of a smile , when she saw that \n",
      "with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had \n",
      "been a smile of secret delight , she had less \n",
      "scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with \n",
      "respect to her. -- This amiable , upright , perfect \n",
      "Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings . He \n",
      "brought all the music to her , and they looked \n",
      "it over together. -- Emma took the opportunity of whispering \n",
      ", '' You speak too plain . She must understand \n",
      "you . '' `` I hope she does . I \n",
      "would have her understand me . I am not in \n",
      "the least ashamed of my meaning . '' `` But \n",
      "really , I am half ashamed , and wish I \n",
      "had never taken up the idea . '' `` I \n",
      "am very glad you did , and that you communicated \n",
      "it to me . I have now a key to \n",
      "all her odd looks and ways . Leave shame to \n",
      "her . If she does wrong , she ought to \n",
      "feel it . '' `` She is not entirely without \n",
      "it , I think . '' `` I do not \n",
      "see much sign of it . She is playing _Robin_ \n",
      "_Adair_ at this moment -- _his_ favourite . '' Shortly \n",
      "afterwards Miss Bates , passing near the window , descried \n",
      "Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off . `` Mr. \n",
      "Knightley I declare ! -- I must speak to him \n",
      "if possible , just to thank him . I will \n",
      "not open the window here ; it would give you \n",
      "all cold ; but I can go into my mother \n",
      "'s room you know . I dare say he will \n",
      "come in when he knows who is here . Quite \n",
      "delightful to have you all meet so ! -- Our \n",
      "little room so honoured ! '' She was in the \n",
      "adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the \n",
      "casement there , immediately called Mr. Knightley 's attention , \n",
      "and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard \n",
      "by the others , as if it had passed within \n",
      "the same apartment . `` How d ' ye do \n",
      "? -- how d 'ye do ? -- Very well \n",
      ", I thank you . So obliged to you for \n",
      "the carriage last night . We were just in time \n",
      "; my mother just ready for us . Pray come \n",
      "in ; do come in . You will find some \n",
      "friends here . '' So began Miss Bates ; and \n",
      "Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn \n",
      ", for most resolutely and commandingly did he say , \n",
      "'' How is your niece , Miss Bates ? -- \n",
      "I want to inquire after you all , but particularly \n",
      "your niece . How is Miss Fairfax ? -- I \n",
      "hope she caught no cold last night . How is \n",
      "she to-day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . \n",
      "'' And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct \n",
      "answer before he would hear her in any thing else \n",
      ". The listeners were amused ; and Mrs. Weston gave \n",
      "Emma a look of particular meaning . But Emma still \n",
      "shook her head in steady scepticism . `` So obliged \n",
      "to you ! -- so very much obliged to you \n",
      "for the carriage , '' resumed Miss Bates . He \n",
      "cut her short with , '' I am going to \n",
      "Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ? \n",
      "'' `` Oh ! dear , Kingston -- are you \n",
      "? -- Mrs . Cole was saying the other day \n",
      "she wanted something from Kingston . '' `` Mrs. Cole \n",
      "has servants to send . Can I do any thing \n",
      "for _you_ ? '' `` No , I thank you \n",
      ". But do come in . Who do you think \n",
      "is here ? -- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; \n",
      "so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte \n",
      ". Do put up your horse at the Crown , \n",
      "and come in . '' `` Well , '' said \n",
      "he , in a deliberating manner , `` for five \n",
      "minutes , perhaps . '' `` And here is Mrs. \n",
      "Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too ! -- Quite delightful \n",
      "; so many friends ! '' `` No , not \n",
      "now , I thank you . I could not stay \n",
      "two minutes . I must get on to Kingston as \n",
      "fast as I can . '' `` Oh ! do \n",
      "come in . They will be so very happy to \n",
      "see you . '' `` No , no ; your \n",
      "room is full enough . I will call another day \n",
      ", and hear the pianoforte . '' `` Well , \n",
      "I am so sorry ! -- Oh ! Mr. Knightley \n",
      ", what a delightful party last night ; how extremely \n",
      "pleasant. -- Did you ever see such dancing ? -- \n",
      "Was not it delightful ? -- Miss Woodhouse and Mr. \n",
      "Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to \n",
      "it . '' `` Oh ! very delightful indeed ; \n",
      "I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that \n",
      "passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) \n",
      "I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be \n",
      "mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well \n",
      "; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player \n",
      ", without exception , in England . Now , if \n",
      "your friends have any gratitude , they will say something \n",
      "pretty loud about you and me in return ; but \n",
      "I can not stay to hear it . '' `` \n",
      "Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something \n",
      "of consequence -- so shocked ! -- Jane and I \n",
      "are both so shocked about the apples ! '' `` \n",
      "What is the matter now ? '' `` To think \n",
      "of your sending us all your store apples . You \n",
      "said you had a great many , and now you \n",
      "have not one left . We really are so shocked \n",
      "! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins \n",
      "mentioned it here . You should not have done it \n",
      ", indeed you should not . Ah ! he is \n",
      "off . He never can bear to be thanked . \n",
      "But I thought he would have staid now , and \n",
      "it would have been a pity not to have mentioned \n",

      "room , ) I have not been able to succeed \n",
      ". Mr. Knightley can not stop . He is going \n",
      "to Kingston . He asked me if he could do \n",
      "any thing . . . . '' `` Yes , \n",
      "'' said Jane , `` we heard his kind offers \n",
      ", we heard every thing . '' `` Oh ! \n",
      "yes , my dear , I dare say you might \n",
      ", because you know , the door was open , \n",
      "and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke \n",
      "loud . You must have heard every thing to be \n",
      "sure . ` Can I do any thing for you \n",
      "at Kingston ? ' said he ; so I just \n",
      "mentioned . . . . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , \n",
      "must you be going ? -- You seem but just \n",
      "come -- so very obliging of you . '' Emma \n",
      "found it really time to be at home ; the \n",
      "visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches \n",
      ", so much of the morning was perceived to be \n",
      "gone , that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave \n",
      "also , could allow themselves only to walk with the \n",
      "two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set \n",
      "off for Randalls . CHAPTER XI It may be possible \n",
      "to do without dancing entirely . Instances have been known \n",
      "of young people passing many , many months successively , \n",
      "without being at any ball of any description , and \n",
      "no material injury accrue either to body or mind ; \n",
      "-- but when a beginning is made -- when the \n",
      "felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly \n",
      ", felt -- it must be a very heavy set \n",
      "that does not ask for more . Frank Churchill had \n",
      "danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again \n",
      "; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls \n",
      ", was passed by the two young people in schemes \n",
      "on the subject . Frank 's was the first idea \n",
      "; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; \n",
      "for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties \n",
      ", and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . \n",
      "But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again \n",
      "how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- \n",
      "for doing that in which she need not blush to \n",
      "compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple \n",
      "dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of \n",
      "vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the \n",
      "room they were in to see what it could be \n",
      "made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions \n",
      "of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering \n",
      ", in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say \n",
      "of their exactly equal size , that it was a \n",
      "little the largest . His first proposition and request , \n",
      "that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's should be finished \n",
      "there -- that the same party should be collected , \n",
      "and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest \n",
      "acquiescence . Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough \n",
      "enjoyment , and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play \n",
      "as long as they could wish to dance ; and \n",
      "the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly \n",
      "who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable \n",
      "division of space to every couple . `` You and \n",
      "Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three \n",
      ", and the two Miss Coxes five , '' had \n",
      "been repeated many times over . `` And there will \n",
      "be the two Gilberts , young Cox , my father \n",
      ", and myself , besides Mr. Knightley . Yes , \n",
      "that will be quite enough for pleasure . You and \n",
      "Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three \n",
      ", and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for \n",
      "five couple there will be plenty of room . '' \n",
      "But soon it came to be on one side , \n",
      "'' But will there be good room for five couple \n",
      "? -- I really do not think there will . \n",
      "'' On another , '' And after all , five \n",
      "couple are not enough to make it worth while to \n",
      "stand up . Five couple are nothing , when one \n",
      "thinks seriously about it . It will not do to \n",
      "_invite_ five couple . It can be allowable only as \n",
      "the thought of the moment . '' Somebody said that \n",
      "_Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother 's , and \n",
      "must be invited with the rest . Somebody else believed \n",
      "_Mrs_ . Gilbert would have danced the other evening , \n",
      "if she had been asked . A word was put \n",
      "in for a second young Cox ; and at last \n",
      ", Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must \n",
      "be included , and another of very old acquaintance who \n",
      "could not be left out , it became a certainty \n",
      "that the five couple would be at least ten , \n",
      "and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they \n",
      "could be disposed of . The doors of the two \n",
      "rooms were just opposite each other . `` Might not \n",
      "they use both rooms , and dance across the passage \n",
      "? '' It seemed the best scheme ; and yet \n",
      "it was not so good but that many of them \n",
      "wanted a better . Emma said it would be awkward \n",
      "; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper ; \n",
      "and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score \n",
      "of health . It made him so very unhappy , \n",
      "indeed , that it could not be persevered in . \n",
      "`` Oh ! no , '' said he ; `` \n",
      "it would be the extreme of imprudence . I could \n",
      "not bear it for Emma ! -- Emma is not \n",
      "strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So \n",
      "would poor little Harriet . So you would all . \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; \n",
      "do not let them talk of such a wild thing \n",
      ". Pray do not let them talk of it . \n",
      "That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless \n",
      ". Do not tell his father , but that young \n",
      "man is not quite the thing . He has been \n",
      "opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping \n",
      "them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of \n",
      "the draught . I do not mean to set you \n",
      "against him , but indeed he is not quite the \n",
      "thing ! '' Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a \n",
      "charge . She knew the importance of it , and \n",
      "said every thing in her power to do it away \n",
      ". Every door was now closed , the passage plan \n",
      "given up , and the first scheme of dancing only \n",
      "in the room they were in resorted to again ; \n",
      "and with such good-will on Frank Churchill 's part , \n",
      "that the space which a quarter of an hour before \n",
      "had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was \n",
      "now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten \n",
      ". `` We were too magnificent , '' said he \n",
      ". `` We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may \n",
      "stand here very well . '' Emma demurred . `` \n",
      "It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; \n",
      "and what could be worse than dancing without space to \n",
      "turn in ? '' `` Very true , '' he \n",
      "gravely replied ; `` it was very bad . '' \n",
      "But still he went on measuring , and still he \n",
      "ended with , '' I think there will be very \n",
      "tolerable room for ten couple . '' `` No , \n",
      "no , '' said she , `` you are quite \n",
      "unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so \n",
      "close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to \n",
      "be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in \n",
      "a little room ! '' `` There is no denying \n",
      "it , '' he replied . `` I agree with \n",
      "you exactly . A crowd in a little room -- \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures \n",
      "in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite ! \n",
      "-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , \n",
      "one is unwilling to give the matter up . It \n",
      "would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether \n",
      "-- I do not know that -- I am rather \n",
      "of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well \n",
      ". '' Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry \n",
      "was a little self-willed , and that he would rather \n",
      "oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; \n",
      "but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest \n",
      ". Had she intended ever to _marry_ him , it \n",
      "might have been worth while to pause and consider , \n",
      "and try to understand the value of his preference , \n",
      "and the character of his temper ; but for all \n",
      "the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable \n",
      "enough . Before the middle of the next day , \n",
      "he was at Hartfield ; and he entered the room \n",
      "with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of \n",
      "the scheme . It soon appeared that he came to \n",
      "announce an improvement . `` Well , Miss Woodhouse , \n",
      "'' he almost immediately began , `` your inclination for \n",
      "dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope \n",
      ", by the terrors of my father 's little rooms \n",
      ". I bring a new proposal on the subject : \n",
      "-- a thought of my father 's , which waits \n",
      "only your approbation to be acted upon . May I \n",
      "hope for the honour of your hand for the two \n",
      "first dances of this little projected ball , to be \n",
      "given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown \n",
      "Inn ? '' `` The Crown ! '' `` Yes \n",

      "and I trust you can not , my father hopes \n",
      "his friends will be so kind as to visit him \n",
      "there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , \n",
      "and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . \n",
      "It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no \n",
      "objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This \n",
      "is what we all feel . Oh ! you were \n",
      "perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the \n",
      "Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable ! -- Dreadful \n",
      "! -- I felt how right you were the whole \n",
      "time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ \n",
      "to like to yield . Is not it a good \n",

      "? '' `` It appears to me a plan that \n",
      "nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston \n",
      "do not . I think it admirable ; and , \n",
      "as far as I can answer for myself , shall \n",
      "be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that \n",
      "could be . Papa , do you not think it \n",
      "an excellent improvement ? '' She was obliged to repeat \n",
      "and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; \n",
      "and then , being quite new , farther representations were \n",
      "necessary to make it acceptable . `` No ; he \n",
      "thought it very far from an improvement -- a very \n",
      "bad plan -- much worse than the other . A \n",
      "room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; \n",
      "never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . \n",
      "If they must dance , they had better dance at \n",
      "Randalls . He had never been in the room at \n",
      "the Crown in his life -- did not know the \n",
      "people who kept it by sight. -- Oh ! no \n",
      "-- a very bad plan . They would catch worse \n",
      "colds at the Crown than anywhere . '' `` I \n",
      "was going to observe , sir , '' said Frank \n",
      "Churchill , '' that one of the great recommendations of \n",
      "this change would be the very little danger of any \n",
      "body 's catching cold -- so much less danger at \n",
      "the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have \n",
      "reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could \n",
      ". '' `` Sir , '' said Mr. Woodhouse , \n",
      "rather warmly , `` you are very much mistaken if \n",
      "you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character \n",
      ". Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us \n",
      "are ill . But I do not understand how the \n",
      "room at the Crown can be safer for you than \n",
      "your father 's house . '' `` From the very \n",
      "circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall \n",
      "have no occasion to open the windows at all -- \n",
      "not once the whole evening ; and it is that \n",
      "dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold \n",
      "air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well \n",
      "know , sir ) does the mischief . '' `` \n",
      "Open the windows ! -- but surely , Mr. Churchill \n",
      ", nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls \n",
      ". Nobody could be so imprudent ! I never heard \n",
      "of such a thing . Dancing with open windows ! \n",
      "-- I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. \n",
      "Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer \n",
      "it . '' `` Ah ! sir -- but a \n",
      "thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain , \n",

      "`` Have you indeed , sir ? -- Bless me \n",

      "at what I hear . However , this does make \n",
      "a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come \n",
      "to talk it over -- but these sort of things \n",
      "require a good deal of consideration . One can not \n",
      "resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and \n",
      "Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here \n",
      "one morning , we may talk it over , and \n",

      "There , papa ! -- Now you must be satisfied \n",
      "-- Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness \n",

      "that is , you would have been very bad , \n",
      "but for Perry 's great attention . He came four \n",
      "times a day for a week . He said , \n",
      "from the first , it was a very good sort \n",
      "-- which was our great comfort ; but the measles \n",
      "are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella \n",

      "all over while she was gone , the two young \n",
      "people set off together without delay for the Crown . \n",

      "time of the ballroom 's being built , suppers had \n",
      "not been in question ; and a small card-room adjoining \n",
      ", was the only addition . What was to be \n",
      "done ? This card-room would be wanted as a card-room \n",
      "now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary \n",
      "by their four selves , still was it not too \n",
      "small for any comfortable supper ? Another room of much \n",
      "better size might be secured for the purpose ; but \n",
      "it was at the other end of the house , \n",
      "and a long awkward passage must be gone through to \n",
      "get at it . This made a difficulty . Mrs. \n",
      "Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in \n",
      "that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could \n",
      "tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper . \n",
      "Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches \n",
      ", & c. , set out in the little room \n",
      "; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion . \n",
      "A private dance , without sitting down to supper , \n",
      "was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men \n",
      "and women ; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of \n",
      "it again . She then took another line of expediency \n",
      ", and looking into the doubtful room , observed , \n",
      "'' I do not think it _is_ so very small \n",
      ". We shall not be many , you know . \n",
      "'' And Mr. Weston at the same time , walking \n",
      "briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling \n",
      "out , '' You talk a great deal of the \n",
      "length of this passage , my dear . It is \n",
      "a mere nothing after all ; and not the least \n",
      "draught from the stairs . '' `` I wish , \n",
      "'' said Mrs. Weston , `` one could know which \n",
      "arrangement our guests in general would like best . To \n",
      "do what would be most generally pleasing must be our \n",
      "object -- if one could but tell what that would \n",
      "be . '' `` Yes , very true , '' \n",
      "cried Frank , `` very true . You want your \n",
      "neighbours' opinions . I do not wonder at you . \n",
      "If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- \n",
      "the Coles , for instance . They are not far \n",
      "off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss \n",
      "Bates ? She is still nearer. -- And I do \n",
      "not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to \n",
      "understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as \n",
      "any body . I think we do want a larger \n",
      "council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to \n",
      "join us ? '' `` Well -- if you please \n",
      ", '' said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating , `` if \n",
      "you think she will be of any use . '' \n",
      "`` You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss \n",
      "Bates , '' said Emma . `` She will be \n",
      "all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you \n",
      "nothing . She will not even listen to your questions \n",
      ". I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . \n",
      "'' `` But she is so amusing , so extremely \n",
      "amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates \n",
      "talk . And I need not bring the whole family \n",
      ", you know . '' Here Mr. Weston joined them \n",
      ", and on hearing what was proposed , gave it \n",
      "his decided approbation . `` Aye , do , Frank. \n",
      "-- Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us \n",
      "end the matter at once . She will enjoy the \n",
      "scheme , I am sure ; and I do not \n",
      "know a properer person for shewing us how to do \n",
      "away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing \n",
      "a little too nice . She is a standing lesson \n",
      "of how to be happy . But fetch them both \n",
      ". Invite them both . '' `` Both sir ! \n",
      "Can the old lady ? '' . . . `` \n",
      "The old lady ! No , the young lady , \n",
      "to be sure . I shall think you a great \n",
      "blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without \n",
      "the niece . '' `` Oh ! I beg your \n",
      "pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . \n",
      "Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to \n",
      "persuade them both . '' And away he ran . \n",
      "Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat \n",
      ", brisk-moving aunt , and her elegant niece , -- \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , like a sweet-tempered woman and a good \n",
      "wife , had examined the passage again , and found \n",
      "the evils of it much less than she had supposed \n",
      "before -- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the \n",
      "difficulties of decision . All the rest , in speculation \n",
      "at least , was perfectly smooth . All the minor \n",
      "arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , \n",
      "tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left \n",
      "as mere trifles to be settled at any time between \n",
      "Mrs. Weston and Mrs . Stokes. -- Every body invited \n",
      ", was certainly to come ; Frank had already written \n",
      "to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his \n",
      "fortnight , which could not possibly be refused . And \n",
      "a delightful dance it was to be . Most cordially \n",
      ", when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that \n",
      "it must . As a counsellor she was not wanted \n",
      "; but as an approver , ( a much safer \n",
      "character , ) she was truly welcome . Her approbation \n",
      ", at once general and minute , warm and incessant \n",
      ", could not but please ; and for another half-hour \n",
      "they were all walking to and fro , between the \n",
      "different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and \n",
      "all in happy enjoyment of the future . The party \n",
      "did not break up without Emma 's being positively secured \n",
      "for the two first dances by the hero of the \n",
      "evening , nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to \n",
      "his wife , `` He has asked her , my \n",
      "dear . That 's right . I knew he would \n",
      "! '' CHAPTER XII One thing only was wanting to \n",
      "make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma \n",
      "-- its being fixed for a day within the granted \n",
      "term of Frank Churchill 's stay in Surry ; for \n",
      ", in spite of Mr. Weston 's confidence , she \n",
      "could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills \n",
      "might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond \n",
      "his fortnight . But this was not judged feasible . \n",
      "The preparations must take their time , nothing could be \n",
      "properly ready till the third week were entered on , \n",
      "and for a few days they must be planning , \n",
      "proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk -- \n",
      "in her opinion , the great risk , of its \n",
      "being all in vain . Enscombe however was gracious , \n",
      "gracious in fact , if not in word . His \n",
      "wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but \n",
      "it was not opposed . All was safe and prosperous \n",
      "; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes \n",
      "way for another , Emma , being now certain of \n",
      "her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation \n",
      "Mr. Knightley's provoking indifference about it . Either because he \n",
      "did not dance himself , or because the plan had \n",
      "been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved \n",
      "that it should not interest him , determined against its \n",
      "exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future \n",
      "amusement . To her voluntary communications Emma could get no \n",
      "more approving reply , than , '' Very well . \n",
      "If the Westons think it worth while to be at \n",
      "all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment \n",
      ", I have nothing to say against it , but \n",
      "that they shall not chuse pleasures for me. -- Oh \n",
      "! yes , I must be there ; I could \n",
      "not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake \n",
      "as I can ; but I would rather be at \n",
      "home , looking over William Larkins 's week 's account \n",
      "; much rather , I confess. -- Pleasure in seeing \n",
      "dancing ! -- not I , indeed -- I never \n",
      "look at it -- I do not know who does. \n",
      "-- Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , \n",
      "must be its own reward . Those who are standing \n",
      "by are usually thinking of something very different . '' \n",
      "This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it \n",
      "made her quite angry . It was not in compliment \n",
      "to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent , \n",
      "or so indignant ; he was not guided by _her_ \n",
      "feelings in reprobating the ball , for _she_ enjoyed the \n",
      "thought of it to an extraordinary degree . It made \n",
      "her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said ; \n",
      "-- '' Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing \n",
      "may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment \n",
      "it would be ! I do look forward to it \n",
      ", I own , with _very_ great pleasure . '' \n",
      "It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he \n",
      "would have preferred the society of William Larkins . No \n",
      "! -- she was more and more convinced that Mrs. \n",
      "Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise . There was \n",
      "a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on \n",
      "his side -- but no love . Alas ! there \n",
      "was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley . \n",
      "Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the \n",
      "over-throw of every thing . A letter arrived from Mr. \n",
      "Churchill to urge his nephew 's instant return . Mrs. \n",
      "Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without \n",
      "him ; she had been in a very suffering state \n",
      "( so said her husband ) when writing to her \n",
      "nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness \n",
      "to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking \n",
      "of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but \n",
      "now she was too ill to trifle , and must \n",
      "entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay . \n",
      "The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , \n",
      "in a note from Mrs. Weston , instantly . As \n",
      "to his going , it was inevitable . He must \n",
      "be gone within a few hours , though without feeling \n",
      "any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his \n",
      "repugnance . He knew her illnesses ; they never occurred \n",
      "but for her own convenience . Mrs. Weston added , \n",
      "`` that he could only allow himself time to hurry \n",
      "to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of \n",
      "the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel \n",
      "any interest in him ; and that he might be \n",
      "expected at Hartfield very soon . '' This wretched note \n",
      "was the finale of Emma 's breakfast . When once \n",
      "it had been read , there was no doing any \n",
      "thing , but lament and exclaim . The loss of \n",
      "the ball -- the loss of the young man -- \n",
      "and all that the young man might be feeling ! \n",
      "-- It was too wretched ! -- Such a delightful \n",
      "evening as it would have been ! -- Every body \n",
      "so happy ! and she and her partner the happiest \n",
      "! -- '' I said it would be so , \n",
      "'' was the only consolation . Her father 's feelings \n",
      "were quite distinct . He thought principally of Mrs. Churchill \n",
      "'s illness , and wanted to know how she was \n",
      "treated ; and as for the ball , it was \n",
      "shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would \n",
      "all be safer at home . Emma was ready for \n",
      "her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if \n",
      "this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful \n",
      "look and total want of spirits when he did come \n",
      "might redeem him . He felt the going away almost \n",
      "too much to speak of it . His dejection was \n",
      "most evident . He sat really lost in thought for \n",
      "the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , \n",
      "it was only to say , '' Of all horrid \n",
      "things , leave-taking is the worst . '' `` But \n",
      "you will come again , '' said Emma . `` \n",
      "This will not be your only visit to Randalls . \n",
      "'' `` Ah ! -- ( shaking his head ) \n",
      "-- the uncertainty of when I may be able to \n",
      "return ! -- I shall try for it with a \n",
      "zeal ! -- It will be the object of all \n",
      "my thoughts and cares ! -- and if my uncle \n",
      "and aunt go to town this spring -- but I \n",
      "am afraid -- they did not stir last spring -- \n",
      "I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever \n",
      ". '' `` Our poor ball must be quite given \n",
      "up . '' `` Ah ! that ball ! -- \n",
      "why did we wait for any thing ? -- why \n",
      "not seize the pleasure at once ? -- How often \n",
      "is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation ! -- \n",
      "You told us it would be so. -- Oh ! \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ? \n",
      "'' `` Indeed , I am very sorry to be \n",
      "right in this instance . I would much rather have \n",
      "been merry than wise . '' `` If I can \n",
      "come again , we are still to have our ball \n",
      ". My father depends on it . Do not forget \n",
      "your engagement . '' Emma looked graciously . `` Such \n",
      "a fortnight as it has been ! '' he continued \n",
      "; `` every day more precious and more delightful than \n",
      "the day before ! -- every day making me less \n",
      "fit to bear any other place . Happy those , \n",
      "who can remain at Highbury ! '' `` As you \n",
      "do us such ample justice now , '' said Emma \n",
      ", laughing , `` I will venture to ask , \n",
      "whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first \n",
      "? Do not we rather surpass your expectations ? I \n",
      "am sure we do . I am sure you did \n",
      "not much expect to like us . You would not \n",
      "have been so long in coming , if you had \n",
      "had a pleasant idea of Highbury . '' He laughed \n",
      "rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , Emma \n",
      "was convinced that it had been so . `` And \n",
      "you must be off this very morning ? '' `` \n",
      "Yes ; my father is to join me here : \n",
      "we shall walk back together , and I must be \n",
      "off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment \n",
      "will bring him . '' `` Not five minutes to \n",
      "spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates \n",
      "? How unlucky ! Miss Bates 's powerful , argumentative \n",
      "mind might have strengthened yours . '' `` Yes -- \n",
      "I _have_ called there ; passing the door , I \n",
      "thought it better . It was a right thing to \n",
      "do . I went in for three minutes , and \n",
      "was detained by Miss Bates 's being absent . She \n",
      "was out ; and I felt it impossible not to \n",
      "wait till she came in . She is a woman \n",
      "that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; \n",
      "but that one would not wish to slight . It \n",
      "was better to pay my visit , then '' -- \n",
      "He hesitated , got up , walked to a window \n",
      ". `` In short , '' said he , `` \n",
      "perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly \n",
      "be quite without suspicion '' -- He looked at her \n",
      ", as if wanting to read her thoughts . She \n",
      "hardly knew what to say . It seemed like the \n",
      "forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not \n",
      "wish . Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in \n",
      "the hope of putting it by , she calmly said \n",
      ", '' You are quite in the right ; it \n",
      "was most natural to pay your visit , then '' \n",
      "-- He was silent . She believed he was looking \n",
      "at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said \n",
      ", and trying to understand the manner . She heard \n",
      "him sigh . It was natural for him to feel \n",
      "that he had _cause_ to sigh . He could not \n",
      "believe her to be encouraging him . A few awkward \n",
      "moments passed , and he sat down again ; and \n",
      "in a more determined manner said , '' It was \n",
      "something to feel that all the rest of my time \n",
      "might be given to Hartfield . My regard for Hartfield \n",
      "is most warm '' -- He stopt again , rose \n",
      "again , and seemed quite embarrassed. -- He was more \n",
      "in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and \n",
      "who can say how it might have ended , if \n",
      "his father had not made his appearance ? Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him \n",
      "composed . A very few minutes more , however , \n",
      "completed the present trial . Mr. Weston , always alert \n",
      "when business was to be done , and as incapable \n",
      "of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of \n",
      "foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , `` It \n",
      "was time to go ; '' and the young man \n",
      ", though he might and did sigh , could not \n",
      "but agree , to take leave . `` I shall \n",
      "hear about you all , '' said he ; `` \n",
      "that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of \n",
      "every thing that is going on among you . I \n",
      "have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She \n",
      "has been so kind as to promise it . Oh \n",
      "! the blessing of a female correspondent , when one \n",
      "is really interested in the absent ! -- she will \n",
      "tell me every thing . In her letters I shall \n",
      "be at dear Highbury again . '' A very friendly \n",
      "shake of the hand , a very earnest `` Good-bye \n",
      ", '' closed the speech , and the door had \n",
      "soon shut out Frank Churchill . Short had been the \n",
      "notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; \n",
      "and Emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw \n",
      "so great a loss to their little society from his \n",
      "absence as to begin to be afraid of being too \n",
      "sorry , and feeling it too much . It was \n",
      "a sad change . They had been meeting almost every \n",
      "day since his arrival . Certainly his being at Randalls \n",
      "had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- \n",
      "indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing \n",
      "him which every morning had brought , the assurance of \n",
      "his attentions , his liveliness , his manners ! It \n",
      "had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must \n",
      "be the sinking from it into the common course of \n",
      "Hartfield days . To complete every other recommendation , he \n",
      "had _almost_ told her that he loved her . What \n",
      "strength , or what constancy of affection he might be \n",
      "subject to , was another point ; but at present \n",
      "she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration \n",
      ", a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion \n",
      ", joined to all the rest , made her think \n",
      "that she _must_ be a little in love with him \n",
      ", in spite of every previous determination against it . \n",
      "`` I certainly must , '' said she . `` \n",
      "This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this \n",
      "disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling \n",
      "of every thing 's being dull and insipid about the \n",
      "house ! -- I must be in love ; I \n",
      "should be the oddest creature in the world if I \n",
      "were not -- for a few weeks at least . \n",
      "Well ! evil to some is always good to others \n",
      ". I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball , \n",
      "if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will \n",
      "be happy . He may spend the evening with his \n",
      "dear William Larkins now if he likes . '' Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , however , shewed no triumphant happiness . He \n",
      "could not say that he was sorry on his own \n",
      "account ; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him \n",
      "if he had ; but he said , and very \n",
      "steadily , that he was sorry for the disappointment of \n",
      "the others , and with considerable kindness added , '' \n",
      "You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of \n",
      "dancing , you are really out of luck ; you \n",
      "are very much out of luck ! '' It was \n",
      "some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge \n",
      "of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but \n",
      "when they did meet , her composure was odious . \n",
      "She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from \n",
      "headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare \n",
      ", that had the ball taken place , she did \n",
      "not think Jane could have attended it ; and it \n",
      "was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to \n",
      "the languor of ill-health . CHAPTER XIII Emma continued to \n",
      "entertain no doubt of her being in love . Her \n",
      "ideas only varied as to the how much . At \n",
      "first , she thought it was a good deal ; \n",
      "and afterwards , but little . She had great pleasure \n",
      "in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for \n",
      "his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. \n",
      "and Mrs. Weston ; she was very often thinking of \n",
      "him , and quite impatient for a letter , that \n",
      "she might know how he was , how were his \n",
      "spirits , how was his aunt , and what was \n",
      "the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring \n",
      ". But , on the other hand , she could \n",
      "not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after \n",
      "the first morning , to be less disposed for employment \n",

      "sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes \n",
      "for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying \n",
      "interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion \n",
      "of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she \n",
      "_refused_ _him_ . Their affection was always to subside into \n",
      "friendship . Every thing tender and charming was to mark \n",
      "their parting ; but still they were to part . \n",
      "When she became sensible of this , it struck her \n",
      "that she could not be very much in love ; \n",
      "for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never \n",
      "to quit her father , never to marry , a \n",
      "strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than \n",
      "she could foresee in her own feelings . `` I \n",
      "do not find myself making any use of the word \n",
      "_sacrifice_ , '' said she. -- '' In not one \n",
      "of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , \n",
      "is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . I \n",
      "do suspect that he is not really necessary to my \n",

      "not persuade myself to feel more than I do . \n",
      "I am quite enough in love . I should be \n",
      "sorry to be more . '' Upon the whole , \n",
      "she was equally contented with her view of his feelings \n",
      ". `` _He_ is undoubtedly very much in love -- \n",
      "every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed \n",
      "! -- and when he comes again , if his \n",

      "do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made \n",

      "had believed me at all to share his feelings , \n",
      "he would not have been so wretched . Could he \n",
      "have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at \n",
      "parting would have been different. -- Still , however , \n",
      "I must be on my guard . This is in \n",
      "the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is \n",
      "; but I do not know that I expect it \n",
      "will ; I do not look upon him to be \n",
      "quite the sort of man -- I do not altogether \n",
      "build upon his steadiness or constancy. -- His feelings are \n",
      "warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable. -- \n",
      "Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes \n",

      "Mrs. Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it \n",
      "; and she read it with a degree of pleasure \n",
      "and admiration which made her at first shake her head \n",
      "over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued \n",
      "their strength . It was a long , well-written letter \n",
      ", giving the particulars of his journey and of his \n",
      "feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and \n",
      "respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every \n",
      "thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , \n",
      "with spirit and precision . No suspicious flourishes now of \n",
      "apology or concern ; it was the language of real \n",
      "feeling towards Mrs. Weston ; and the transition from Highbury \n",
      "to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some \n",
      "of the first blessings of social life was just enough \n",
      "touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , \n",
      "and how much more might have been said but for \n",
      "the restraints of propriety. -- The charm of her own \n",
      "name was not wanting . _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than \n",
      "once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion \n",
      ", either a compliment to her taste , or a \n",
      "remembrance of what she had said ; and in the \n",
      "very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned \n",
      "as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry \n",
      ", she yet could discern the effect of her influence \n",
      "and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed . \n",

      "-- '' I had not a spare moment on Tuesday \n",

      "little friend . Pray make my excuses and adieus to \n",
      "her . '' This , Emma could not doubt , \n",
      "was all for herself . Harriet was remembered only from \n",
      "being _her_ friend . His information and prospects as to \n",
      "Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated \n",
      "; Mrs. Churchill was recovering , and he dared not \n",
      "yet , even in his own imagination , fix a \n",

      ", and stimulative as was the letter in the material \n",
      "part , its sentiments , she yet found , when \n",
      "it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston , \n",
      "that it had not added any lasting warmth , that \n",
      "she could still do without the writer , and that \n",

      "were unchanged . Her resolution of refusal only grew more \n",
      "interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent \n",
      "consolation and happiness . His recollection of Harriet , and \n",
      "the words which clothed it , the `` beautiful little \n",
      "friend , '' suggested to her the idea of Harriet \n",
      "'s succeeding her in his affections . Was it impossible \n",
      "? -- No. -- Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior \n",
      "in understanding ; but he had been very much struck \n",
      "with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity \n",
      "of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance \n",
      "and connexion were in her favour. -- For Harriet , \n",
      "it would be advantageous and delightful indeed . `` I \n",
      "must not dwell upon it , '' said she. -- \n",
      "'' I must not think of it . I know \n",
      "the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things \n",
      "have happened ; and when we cease to care for \n",
      "each other as we do now , it will be \n",
      "the means of confirming us in that sort of true \n",
      "disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with \n",
      "pleasure . '' It was well to have a comfort \n",
      "in store on Harriet 's behalf , though it might \n",
      "be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; \n",
      "for evil in that quarter was at hand . As \n",
      "Frank Churchill 's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton 's engagement \n",
      "in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest \n",
      "had entirely borne down the first , so now upon \n",
      "Frank Churchill 's disappearance , Mr. Elton 's concerns were \n",
      "assuming the most irresistible form. -- His wedding-day was named \n",
      ". He would soon be among them again ; Mr. \n",
      "Elton and his bride . There was hardly time to \n",
      "talk over the first letter from Enscombe before `` Mr. \n",
      "Elton and his bride '' was in every body 's \n",
      "mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten . Emma grew \n",
      "sick at the sound . She had had three weeks \n",
      "of happy exemption from Mr. Elton ; and Harriet 's \n",
      "mind , she had been willing to hope , had \n",
      "been lately gaining strength . With Mr. Weston 's ball \n",
      "in view at least , there had been a great \n",
      "deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was \n",
      "now too evident that she had not attained such a \n",
      "state of composure as could stand against the actual approach \n",
      "-- new carriage , bell-ringing , and all . Poor \n",
      "Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all \n",
      "the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that \n",
      "Emma could give . Emma felt that she could not \n",
      "do too much for her , that Harriet had a \n",
      "right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; \n",
      "but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing \n",
      "without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , \n",
      "without being able to make their opinions the same . \n",
      "Harriet listened submissively , and said `` it was very \n",
      "true -- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- \n",
      "it was not worth while to think about them -- \n",
      "and she would not think about them any longer '' \n",
      "but no change of subject could avail , and the \n",
      "next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the \n",
      "Eltons as before . At last Emma attacked her on \n",
      "another ground . `` Your allowing yourself to be so \n",
      "occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton 's marrying , \n",
      "Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ \n",
      ". You could not give me a greater reproof for \n",
      "the mistake I fell into . It was all my \n",
      "doing , I know . I have not forgotten it \n",
      ", I assure you. -- Deceived myself , I did \n",
      "very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a \n",
      "painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine \n",
      "me in danger of forgetting it . '' Harriet felt \n",
      "this too much to utter more than a few words \n",
      "of eager exclamation . Emma continued , '' I have \n",
      "not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; \n",
      "think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my \n",
      "sake ; because for your own sake rather , I \n",
      "would wish it to be done , for the sake \n",
      "of what is more important than my comfort , a \n",
      "habit of self-command in you , a consideration of what \n",
      "is your duty , an attention to propriety , an \n",
      "endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save \n",
      "your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . \n",
      "These are the motives which I have been pressing on \n",
      "you . They are very important -- and sorry I \n",
      "am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act \n",
      "upon them . My being saved from pain is a \n",
      "very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself \n",
      "from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt \n",
      "that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or \n",
      "rather what would be kind by me . '' This \n",
      "appeal to her affections did more than all the rest \n",
      ". The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her \n",
      "wretched for a while , and when the violence of \n",
      "grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to \n",
      "prompt to what was right and support her in it \n",
      "very tolerably . `` You , who have been the \n",
      "best friend I ever had in my life -- Want \n",
      "gratitude to you ! -- Nobody is equal to you \n",
      "! -- I care for nobody as I do for \n",
      "you ! -- Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful \n",
      "I have been ! '' Such expressions , assisted as \n",
      "they were by every thing that look and manner could \n",
      "do , made Emma feel that she had never loved \n",
      "Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly \n",
      "before . `` There is no charm equal to tenderness \n",
      "of heart , '' said she afterwards to herself . \n",
      "`` There is nothing to be compared to it . \n",
      "Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , \n",
      "open manner , will beat all the clearness of head \n",
      "in the world , for attraction , I am sure \n",
      "it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes \n",
      "my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella \n",
      "all her popularity. -- I have it not -- but \n",
      "I know how to prize and respect it. -- Harriet \n",
      "is my superior in all the charm and all the \n",
      "felicity it gives . Dear Harriet ! -- I would \n",
      "not change you for the clearest-headed , longest-sighted , best-judging \n",
      "female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane \n",
      "Fairfax ! -- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- \n",
      "And for a wife -- a sensible man 's wife \n",
      "-- it is invaluable . I mention no names ; \n",
      "but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! \n",
      "'' CHAPTER XIV Mrs. Elton was first seen at church \n",
      ": but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could \n",
      "not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , \n",
      "and it must be left for the visits in form \n",
      "which were then to be paid , to settle whether \n",
      "she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty \n",
      ", or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings \n",
      ", less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , \n",
      "to make her resolve on not being the last to \n",
      "pay her respects ; and she made a point of \n",
      "Harriet 's going with her , that the worst of \n",
      "the business might be gone through as soon as possible \n",
      ". She could not enter the house again , could \n",
      "not be in the same room to which she had \n",
      "with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to \n",
      "lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ . A thousand \n",
      "vexatious thoughts would recur . Compliments , charades , and \n",
      "horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed \n",
      "that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but \n",
      "she behaved very well , and was only rather pale \n",
      "and silent . The visit was of course short ; \n",
      "and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind \n",
      "to shorten it , that Emma would not allow herself \n",
      "entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and \n",
      "on no account to give one , beyond the nothing-meaning \n",
      "terms of being `` elegantly dressed , and very pleasing \n",
      ". '' She did not really like her . She \n",
      "would not be in a hurry to find fault , \n",
      "but she suspected that there was no elegance ; -- \n",
      "ease , but not elegance. -- She was almost sure \n",
      "that for a young woman , a stranger , a \n",
      "bride , there was too much ease . Her person \n",
      "was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but \n",
      "neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor \n",
      "manner , were elegant . Emma thought at least it \n",
      "would turn out so . As for Mr. Elton , \n",
      "his manners did not appear -- but no , she \n",
      "would not permit a hasty or a witty word from \n",
      "herself about his manners . It was an awkward ceremony \n",
      "at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and \n",
      "a man had need be all grace to acquit himself \n",
      "well through it . The woman was better off ; \n",
      "she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and \n",
      "the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only \n",
      "his own good sense to depend on ; and when \n",
      "she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in \n",
      "being in the same room at once with the woman \n",
      "he had just married , the woman he had wanted \n",
      "to marry , and the woman whom he had been \n",
      "expected to marry , she must allow him to have \n",
      "the right to look as little wise , and to \n",
      "be as much affectedly , and as little really easy \n",
      "as could be . `` Well , Miss Woodhouse , \n",
      "'' said Harriet , when they had quitted the house \n",
      ", and after waiting in vain for her friend to \n",
      "begin ; '' Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with \n",
      "a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of \n",
      "her ? -- Is not she very charming ? '' \n",
      "There was a little hesitation in Emma 's answer . \n",
      "`` Oh ! yes -- very -- a very pleasing \n",
      "young woman . '' `` I think her beautiful , \n",
      "quite beautiful . '' `` Very nicely dressed , indeed \n",
      "; a remarkably elegant gown . '' `` I am \n",
      "not at all surprized that he should have fallen in \n",
      "love . '' `` Oh ! no -- there is \n",
      "nothing to surprize one at all. -- A pretty fortune \n",
      "; and she came in his way . '' `` \n",
      "I dare say , '' returned Harriet , sighing again \n",
      ", `` I dare say she was very much attached \n",
      "to him . '' `` Perhaps she might ; but \n",
      "it is not every man 's fate to marry the \n",
      "woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted \n",
      "a home , and thought this the best offer she \n",
      "was likely to have . '' `` Yes , '' \n",
      "said Harriet earnestly , `` and well she might , \n",
      "nobody could ever have a better . Well , I \n",
      "wish them happy with all my heart . And now \n",
      ", Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall \n",
      "mind seeing them again . He is just as superior \n",
      "as ever ; -- but being married , you know \n",
      ", it is quite a different thing . No , \n",
      "indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid \n",
      "; I can sit and admire him now without any \n",
      "great misery . To know that he has not thrown \n",
      "himself away , is such a comfort ! -- She \n",
      "does seem a charming young woman , just what he \n",
      "deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ` Augusta \n",
      ". ' How delightful ! '' When the visit was \n",
      "returned , Emma made up her mind . She could \n",
      "then see more and judge better . From Harriet 's \n",
      "happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father \n",
      "'s being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had \n",
      "a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation \n",
      "to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; \n",
      "and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that \n",
      "Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied \n",
      "with herself , and thinking much of her own importance \n",
      "; that she meant to shine and be very superior \n",
      ", but with manners which had been formed in a \n",
      "bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her \n",
      "notions were drawn from one set of people , and \n",
      "one style of living ; that if not foolish she \n",
      "was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do \n",
      "Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a \n",
      "better match . If not wise or refined herself , \n",
      "she would have connected him with those who were ; \n",
      "but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from \n",
      "her easy conceit , had been the best of her \n",
      "own set . The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the \n",
      "pride of the alliance , and his place and his \n",
      "carriages were the pride of him . The very first \n",
      "subject after being seated was Maple Grove , `` My \n",
      "brother Mr. Suckling 's seat ; '' -- a comparison \n",
      "of Hartfield to Maple Grove . The grounds of Hartfield \n",
      "were small , but neat and pretty ; and the \n",
      "house was modern and well-built . Mrs. Elton seemed most \n",
      "favourably impressed by the size of the room , the \n",
      "entrance , and all that she could see or imagine \n",
      ". `` Very like Maple Grove indeed ! -- She \n",
      "was quite struck by the likeness ! -- That room \n",
      "was the very shape and size of the morning-room at \n",
      "Maple Grove ; her sister 's favourite room . '' \n",
      "-- Mr. Elton was appealed to. -- '' Was not \n",
      "it astonishingly like ? -- She could really almost fancy \n",
      "herself at Maple Grove . '' `` And the staircase \n",
      "-- You know , as I came in , I \n",
      "observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly \n",
      "in the same part of the house . I really \n",
      "could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to \n",
      "be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial \n",
      "to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many \n",
      "happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of \n",
      "sentiment ) . A charming place , undoubtedly . Every \n",
      "body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; \n",
      "but to me , it has been quite a home \n",
      ". Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is \n",
      "to meet with any thing at all like what one \n",
      "has left behind . I always say this is quite \n",
      "one of the evils of matrimony . '' Emma made \n",
      "as slight a reply as she could ; but it \n",
      "was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton , who only wanted \n",
      "to be talking herself . `` So extremely like Maple \n",
      "Grove ! And it is not merely the house -- \n",
      "the grounds , I assure you , as far as \n",
      "I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels \n",
      "at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here \n",
      ", and stand very much in the same way -- \n",
      "just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse \n",
      "of a fine large tree , with a bench round \n",
      "it , which put me so exactly in mind ! \n",
      "My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place \n",
      ". People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased \n",
      "with any thing in the same style . '' Emma \n",
      "doubted the truth of this sentiment . She had a \n",
      "great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared \n",
      "very little for the extensive grounds of any body else \n",
      "; but it was not worth while to attack an \n",
      "error so double-dyed , and therefore only said in reply \n",
      ", '' When you have seen more of this country \n",
      ", I am afraid you will think you have overrated \n",
      "Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties . '' `` \n",
      "Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that \n",
      ". It is the garden of England , you know \n",
      ". Surry is the garden of England . '' `` \n",
      "Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on \n",
      "that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are \n",
      "called the garden of England , as well as Surry \n",
      ". '' `` No , I fancy not , '' \n",
      "replied Mrs. Elton , with a most satisfied smile . \n",
      "'' I never heard any county but Surry called so \n",
      ". '' Emma was silenced . `` My brother and \n",
      "sister have promised us a visit in the spring , \n",
      "or summer at farthest , '' continued Mrs. Elton ; \n",
      "`` and that will be our time for exploring . \n",
      "While they are with us , we shall explore a \n",
      "great deal , I dare say . They will have \n",
      "their barouche-landau , of course , which holds four perfectly \n",
      "; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ \n",
      "carriage , we should be able to explore the different \n",
      "beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their \n",
      "chaise , I think , at that season of the \n",
      "year . Indeed , when the time draws on , \n",
      "I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau ; it \n",
      "will be so very much preferable . When people come \n",
      "into a beautiful country of this sort , you know \n",
      ", Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see \n",
      "as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely \n",
      "fond of exploring . We explored to King's-Weston twice last \n",
      "summer , in that way , most delightfully , just \n",
      "after their first having the barouche-landau . You have many \n",
      "parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , every summer ? '' `` No ; not \n",
      "immediately here . We are rather out of distance of \n",
      "the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties \n",
      "you speak of ; and we are a very quiet \n",
      "set of people , I believe ; more disposed to \n",
      "stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . \n",
      "'' `` Ah ! there is nothing like staying at \n",
      "home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted \n",
      "to home than I am . I was quite a \n",
      "proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time \n",
      "has Selina said , when she has been going to \n",
      "Bristol , ` I really can not get this girl \n",
      "to move from the house . I absolutely must go \n",
      "in by myself , though I hate being stuck up \n",
      "in the barouche-landau without a companion ; but Augusta , \n",
      "I believe , with her own good-will , would never \n",
      "stir beyond the park paling . ' Many a time \n",
      "has she said so ; and yet I am no \n",
      "advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the \n",
      "contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society \n",
      ", it is a very bad thing ; and that \n",
      "it is much more advisable to mix in the world \n",
      "in a proper degree , without living in it either \n",
      "too much or too little . I perfectly understand your \n",
      "situation , however , Miss Woodhouse -- ( looking towards \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father 's state of health \n",
      "must be a great drawback . Why does not he \n",
      "try Bath ? -- Indeed he should . Let me \n",
      "recommend Bath to you . I assure you I have \n",
      "no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . '' \n",
      "`` My father tried it more than once , formerly \n",
      "; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry \n",
      ", whose name , I dare say , is not \n",
      "unknown to you , does not conceive it would be \n",
      "at all more likely to be useful now . '' \n",
      "`` Ah ! that 's a great pity ; for \n",
      "I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters \n",
      "do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they \n",
      "give . In my Bath life , I have seen \n",
      "such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful \n",
      "a place , that it could not fail of being \n",
      "of use to Mr. Woodhouse 's spirits , which , \n",
      "I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as \n",
      "to its recommendations to _you_ , I fancy I need \n",
      "not take much pains to dwell on them . The \n",
      "advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood \n",
      ". It would be a charming introduction for you , \n",
      "who have lived so secluded a life ; and I \n",
      "could immediately secure you some of the best society in \n",
      "the place . A line from me would bring you \n",
      "a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend \n",
      ", Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided \n",
      "with when in Bath , would be most happy to \n",
      "shew you any attentions , and would be the very \n",
      "person for you to go into public with . '' \n",
      "It was as much as Emma could bear , without \n",
      "being impolite . The idea of her being indebted to \n",
      "Mrs. Elton for what was called an _introduction_ -- of \n",
      "her going into public under the auspices of a friend \n",
      "of Mrs. Elton 's -- probably some vulgar , dashing \n",
      "widow , who , with the help of a boarder \n",
      ", just made a shift to live ! -- The \n",
      "dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk \n",
      "indeed ! She restrained herself , however , from any \n",
      "of the reproofs she could have given , and only \n",
      "thanked Mrs. Elton coolly ; `` but their going to \n",
      "Bath was quite out of the question ; and she \n",
      "was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her \n",
      "better than her father . '' And then , to \n",
      "prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly \n",
      ". `` I do not ask whether you are musical \n",
      ", Mrs. Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady \n",
      "'s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long \n",
      "known that you are a superior performer . '' `` \n",
      "Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against \n",
      "any such idea . A superior performer ! -- very \n",
      "far from it , I assure you . Consider from \n",
      "how partial a quarter your information came . I am \n",
      "doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ; -- and \n",
      "my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste \n",
      "; but as to any thing else , upon my \n",
      "honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree . \n",
      "You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play \n",
      "delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest \n",
      "satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to \n",
      "hear what a musical society I am got into . \n",
      "I absolutely can not do without music . It is \n",
      "a necessary of life to me ; and having always \n",
      "been used to a very musical society , both at \n",
      "Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been \n",
      "a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much \n",
      "to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future \n",
      "home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of \n",
      "it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the \n",
      "house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to \n",
      "-- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . \n",
      "When he was speaking of it in that way , \n",
      "I honestly said that _the_ _world_ I could give up \n",
      "-- parties , balls , plays -- for I had \n",
      "no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources \n",
      "within myself , the world was not necessary to _me_ \n",
      ". I could do very well without it . To \n",
      "those who had no resources it was a different thing \n",
      "; but my resources made me quite independent . And \n",
      "as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to \n",
      ", I really could not give it a thought . \n",
      "I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of \n",
      "that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every \n",
      "luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him \n",
      "that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , \n",
      "nor were spacious apartments . ` But , ' said \n",
      "I , ` to be quite honest , I do \n",
      "not think I can live without something of a musical \n",
      "society . I condition for nothing else ; but without \n",
      "music , life would be a blank to me . \n",
      "' '' `` We can not suppose , '' said \n",
      "Emma , smiling , `` that Mr. Elton would hesitate \n",
      "to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society \n",
      "in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find \n",
      "he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned \n",
      ", in consideration of the motive . '' `` No \n",
      ", indeed , I have no doubts at all on \n",
      "that head . I am delighted to find myself in \n",
      "such a circle . I hope we shall have many \n",
      "sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse \n",
      ", you and I must establish a musical club , \n",
      "and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or \n",
      "ours . Will not it be a good plan ? \n",
      "If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not \n",
      "be long in want of allies . Something of that \n",
      "nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an \n",
      "inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women \n",
      ", you know -- there is a sad story against \n",
      "them , in general . They are but too apt \n",
      "to give up music . '' `` But you , \n",
      "who are so extremely fond of it -- there can \n",
      "be no danger , surely ? '' `` I should \n",
      "hope not ; but really when I look around among \n",
      "my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given \n",
      "up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she \n",
      "played sweetly . And the same may be said of \n",
      "Mrs. Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and \n",
      "of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. \n",
      "James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate \n",
      ". Upon my word it is enough to put one \n",
      "in a fright . I used to be quite angry \n",
      "with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend \n",
      "that a married woman has many things to call her \n",
      "attention . I believe I was half an hour this \n",
      "morning shut up with my housekeeper . '' `` But \n",
      "every thing of that kind , '' said Emma , \n",
      "`` will soon be in so regular a train -- \n",
      "'' '' Well , '' said Mrs. Elton , laughing \n",
      ", `` we shall see . '' Emma , finding \n",
      "her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing \n",
      "more to say ; and , after a moment 's \n",
      "pause , Mrs. Elton chose another subject . `` We \n",
      "have been calling at Randalls , '' said she , \n",
      "`` and found them both at home ; and very \n",
      "pleasant people they seem to be . I like them \n",
      "extremely . Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature -- quite \n",
      "a first-rate favourite with me already , I assure you \n",
      ". And _she_ appears so truly good -- there is \n",
      "something so motherly and kind-hearted about her , that it \n",
      "wins upon one directly . She was your governess , \n",
      "I think ? '' Emma was almost too much astonished \n",
      "to answer ; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the \n",
      "affirmative before she went on . `` Having understood as \n",
      "much , I was rather astonished to find her so \n",
      "very lady-like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman \n",
      ". '' `` Mrs. Weston 's manners , '' said \n",
      "Emma , `` were always particularly good . Their propriety \n",
      ", simplicity , and elegance , would make them the \n",
      "safest model for any young woman . '' `` And \n",
      "who do you think came in while we were there \n",
      "? '' Emma was quite at a loss . The \n",
      "tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she \n",
      "possibly guess ? `` Knightley ! '' continued Mrs. Elton \n",
      "; `` Knightley himself ! -- Was not it lucky \n",
      "? -- for , not being within when he called \n",
      "the other day , I had never seen him before \n",
      "; and of course , as so particular a friend \n",
      "of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity \n",
      ". ` My friend Knightley' had been so often mentioned \n",
      ", that I was really impatient to see him ; \n",
      "and I must do my caro sposo the justice to \n",
      "say that he need not be ashamed of his friend \n",
      ". Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him \n",
      "very much . Decidedly , I think , a very \n",
      "gentleman-like man . '' Happily , it was now time \n",
      "to be gone . They were off ; and Emma \n",
      "could breathe . `` Insufferable woman ! '' was her \n",
      "immediate exclamation . `` Worse than I had supposed . \n",
      "Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley ! -- I could not have \n",
      "believed it . Knightley ! -- never seen him in \n",
      "her life before , and call him Knightley ! -- \n",
      "and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little \n",
      "upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , \n",
      "and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and \n",
      "all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . \n",
      "Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman ! \n",
      "I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and \n",
      "discover her to be a lady . I could not \n",
      "have believed it ! And to propose that she and \n",
      "I should unite to form a musical club ! One \n",
      "would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs . \n",
      "Weston ! -- Astonished that the person who had brought \n",
      "me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse \n",
      ". I never met with her equal . Much beyond \n",
      "my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . \n",
      "Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , \n",
      "if he were here ? How angry and how diverted \n",
      "he would be ! Ah ! there I am -- \n",
      "thinking of him directly . Always the first person to \n",
      "be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! \n",
      "Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind ! '' \n",
      "-- All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , \n",
      "that by the time her father had arranged himself , \n",
      "after the bustle of the Eltons' departure , and was \n",
      "ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of \n",
      "attending . `` Well , my dear , '' he \n",
      "deliberately began , `` considering we never saw her before \n",
      ", she seems a very pretty sort of young lady \n",

      "with you . She speaks a little too quick . \n",
      "A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts \n",
      "the ear . But I believe I am nice ; \n",
      "I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks \n",
      "like you and poor Miss Taylor . However , she \n",
      "seems a very obliging , pretty-behaved young lady , and \n",
      "no doubt will make him a very good wife . \n",

      "I made the best excuses I could for not having \n",

      "_should_ in the course of the summer . But I \n",
      "ought to have gone before . Not to wait upon \n",
      "a bride is very remiss . Ah ! it shews \n",
      "what a sad invalid I am ! But I do \n",
      "not like the corner into Vicarage Lane . '' `` \n",
      "I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . \n",
      "Mr. Elton knows you . '' `` Yes : but \n",
      "a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to \n",

      "marry if you make so much of them . '' \n",
      "`` No , my dear , I never encouraged any \n",
      "body to marry , but I would always wish to \n",
      "pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a \n",
      "bride , especially , is never to be neglected . \n",
      "More is avowedly due to _her_ . A bride , \n",

      "ladies . '' `` My dear , you do not \n",
      "understand me . This is a matter of mere common \n",
      "politeness and good-breeding , and has nothing to do with \n",
      "any encouragement to people to marry . '' Emma had \n",
      "done . Her father was growing nervous , and could \n",
      "not understand _her_ . Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton \n",
      "'s offences , and long , very long , did \n",
      "they occupy her . CHAPTER XV Emma was not required \n",
      ", by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill \n",
      "opinion of Mrs. Elton . Her observation had been pretty \n",
      "correct . Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on \n",
      "this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met \n",
      "again , -- self-important , presuming , familiar , ignorant \n",
      ", and ill-bred . She had a little beauty and \n",
      "a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she \n",
      "thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , \n",
      "to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived \n",
      "Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society \n",
      "as Mrs. Elton 's consequence only could surpass . There \n",
      "was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all \n",
      "differently from his wife . He seemed not merely happy \n",
      "with her , but proud . He had the air \n",
      "of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to \n",
      "Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; \n",
      "and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed \n",
      "to commend , or not in the habit of judging \n",
      ", following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will , or \n",
      "taking it for granted that the bride must be as \n",
      "clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were \n",
      "very well satisfied ; so that Mrs. Elton 's praise \n",
      "passed from one mouth to another as it ought to \n",
      "do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued \n",
      "her first contribution and talked with a good grace of \n",
      "her being `` very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . \n",
      "'' In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than \n",
      "she had appeared at first . Her feelings altered towards \n",
      "Emma. -- Offended , probably , by the little encouragement \n",
      "which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew \n",
      "back in her turn and gradually became much more cold \n",
      "and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , \n",
      "the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma 's \n",
      "dislike . Her manners , too -- and Mr. Elton \n",
      "'s , were unpleasant towards Harriet . They were sneering \n",
      "and negligent . Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet \n",
      "'s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such \n",
      "behaviour sunk them both very much. -- It was not \n",
      "to be doubted that poor Harriet 's attachment had been \n",
      "an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share \n",
      "in the story , under a colouring the least favourable \n",
      "to her and the most soothing to him , had \n",
      "in all likelihood been given also . She was , \n",
      "of course , the object of their joint dislike. -- \n",
      "When they had nothing else to say , it must \n",
      "be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and \n",
      "the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect \n",
      "to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment \n",
      "of Harriet . Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to \n",
      "Jane Fairfax ; and from the first . Not merely \n",
      "when a state of warfare with one young lady might \n",
      "be supposed to recommend the other , but from the \n",
      "very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing \n",
      "a natural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation , \n",
      "or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting \n",
      "to assist and befriend her. -- Before Emma had forfeited \n",
      "her confidence , and about the third time of their \n",
      "meeting , she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry on the \n",
      "subject. -- '' Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse. -- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax. -- A \n",
      "sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- \n",
      "and with such talents ! -- I assure you I \n",
      "think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not \n",
      "scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I \n",
      "know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point \n",
      ". Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will \n",
      "laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word \n",
      ", I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax. -- And \n",
      "her situation is so calculated to affect one ! -- \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to \n",
      "do something for her . We must bring her forward \n",
      ". Such talent as hers must not be suffered to \n",
      "remain unknown. -- I dare say you have heard those \n",
      "charming lines of the poet , ` Full many a \n",
      "flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste \n",
      "its fragrance on the desert air . ' We must \n",
      "not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax \n",
      ". '' `` I can not think there is any \n",
      "danger of it , '' was Emma 's calm answer \n",
      "-- '' and when you are better acquainted with Miss \n",
      "Fairfax 's situation and understand what her home has been \n",
      ", with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no \n",

      ". There is great fear , great caution , great \n",
      "resolution somewhere. -- She is _not_ to be with the \n",
      "_Dixons_ . The decree is issued by somebody . But \n",
      "why must she consent to be with the Eltons ? \n",
      "-- Here is quite a separate puzzle . '' Upon \n",
      "her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the \n",

      "with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions \n",
      "from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . \n",
      "'' Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a \n",

      "Fairfax . Mrs. Elton's invitations I should have imagined any \n",
      "thing but inviting . '' `` I should not wonder \n",

      ", by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton \n",
      "'s civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very \n",
      "likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a \n",
      "greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would \n",
      "have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish \n",
      "of a little change . '' Both felt rather anxious \n",
      "to hear him speak again ; and after a few \n",
      "minutes silence , he said , '' Another thing must \n",
      "be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not \n",
      "talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her . \n",
      "We all know the difference between the pronouns he or \n",
      "she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; \n",
      "we all feel the influence of a something beyond common \n",
      "civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a \n",
      "something more early implanted . We can not give any \n",
      "body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very \n",
      "full of the hour before . We feel things differently \n",
      ". And besides the operation of this , as a \n",
      "general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax \n",
      "awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and \n",
      "manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. \n",
      "Elton treats her with all the respect which she has \n",
      "a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax \n",
      "probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- \n",
      "and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her \n",
      "own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness \n",
      ". '' `` I know how highly you think of \n",
      "Jane Fairfax , '' said Emma . Little Henry was \n",
      "in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and \n",
      "delicacy made her irresolute what else to say . `` \n",
      "Yes , '' he replied , `` any body may \n",
      "know how highly I think of her . '' `` \n",
      "And yet , '' said Emma , beginning hastily and \n",
      "with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it \n",
      "was better , however , to know the worst at \n",
      "once -- she hurried on -- '' And yet , \n",
      "perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly \n",
      "it is . The extent of your admiration may take \n",
      "you by surprize some day or other . '' Mr. \n",
      "Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of \n",
      "his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of \n",
      "getting them together , or some other cause , brought \n",
      "the colour into his face , as he answered , \n",
      "'' Oh ! are you there ? -- But you \n",
      "are miserably behindhand . Mr. Cole gave me a hint \n",
      "of it six weeks ago . '' He stopped. -- \n",
      "Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston , and \n",
      "did not herself know what to think . In a \n",
      "moment he went on -- '' That will never be \n",
      ", however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax \n",
      ", I dare say , would not have me if \n",
      "I were to ask her -- and I am very \n",
      "sure I shall never ask her . '' Emma returned \n",
      "her friend 's pressure with interest ; and was pleased \n",
      "enough to exclaim , '' You are not vain , \n",
      "Mr. Knightley . I will say that for you . \n",
      "'' He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was \n",
      "thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not \n",
      "pleased , soon afterwards said , '' So you have \n",
      "been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? '' \n",
      "`` No indeed I have not . You have scolded \n",
      "me too much for match-making , for me to presume \n",
      "to take such a liberty with you . What I \n",
      "said just now , meant nothing . One says those \n",
      "sort of things , of course , without any idea \n",
      "of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon \n",
      "my word I have not the smallest wish for your \n",
      "marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would \n",
      "not come in and sit with us in this comfortable \n",
      "way , if you were married . '' Mr. Knightley \n",
      "was thoughtful again . The result of his reverie was \n",
      ", '' No , Emma , I do not think \n",
      "the extent of my admiration for her will ever take \n",
      "me by surprize. -- I never had a thought of \n",
      "her in that way , I assure you . '' \n",
      "And soon afterwards , `` Jane Fairfax is a very \n",
      "charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is \n",
      "perfect . She has a fault . She has not \n",
      "the open temper which a man would wish for in \n",

      "Cole , I suppose ? '' `` Yes , very \n",
      "soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I \n",
      "told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon \n",
      "and said no more . Cole does not want to \n",
      "be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . '' `` \n",
      "In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton , who \n",
      "wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world \n",
      "! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles -- \n",
      "what she calls them ! How can she find any \n",
      "appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? \n",
      "She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do \n",
      "for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to \n",
      "be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents \n",

      "weighs most with me . I can much more readily \n",
      "enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates \n",
      ", than I can believe in the triumph of Miss \n",
      "Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no \n",
      "faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in \n",
      "thought , word , or deed ; or in her \n",

      "good-breeding . I can not imagine that she will not \n",
      "be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , \n",
      "and offers of service ; that she will not be \n",
      "continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her \n",
      "a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful \n",
      "exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau \n",
      ". '' `` Jane Fairfax has feeling , '' said \n",
      "Mr. Knightley -- '' I do not accuse her of \n",
      "want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , \n",
      "are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power \n",
      "of forbearance , patience , self-controul ; but it wants \n",
      "openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I \n",
      "think , than she used to be -- And I \n",
      "love an open temper . No -- till Cole alluded \n",

      "thought beyond . '' `` Well , Mrs. Weston , \n",
      "'' said Emma triumphantly when he left them , '' \n",
      "what do you say now to Mr. Knightley 's marrying \n",
      "Jane Fairfax ? '' `` Why , really , dear \n",
      "Emma , I say that he is so very much \n",
      "occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with \n",
      "her , that I should not wonder if it were \n",
      "to end in his being so at last . Do \n",
      "not beat me . '' CHAPTER XVI Every body in \n",
      "and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton , \n",
      "was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage . \n",
      "Dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for him and his lady \n",
      "; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had \n",
      "soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have \n",
      "a disengaged day . `` I see how it is \n",
      ", '' said she . `` I see what a \n",
      "life I am to lead among you . Upon my \n",
      "word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem \n",
      "quite the fashion . If this is living in the \n",
      "country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday \n",
      "next to Saturday , I assure you we have not \n",
      "a disengaged day ! -- A woman with fewer resources \n",
      "than I have , need not have been at a \n",
      "loss . '' No invitation came amiss to her . \n",
      "Her Bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her , \n",
      "and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners \n",
      ". She was a little shocked at the want of \n",
      "two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout-cakes \n",
      ", and there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties \n",
      ". Mrs. Bates , Mrs. Perry , Mrs. Goddard and \n",
      "others , were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of \n",
      "the world , but she would soon shew them how \n",
      "every thing ought to be arranged . In the course \n",
      "of the spring she must return their civilities by one \n",
      "very superior party -- in which her card-tables should be \n",
      "set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in \n",
      "the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the \n",
      "evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry \n",
      "round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and \n",
      "in the proper order . Emma , in the meanwhile \n",
      ", could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield \n",
      "for the Eltons . They must not do less than \n",
      "others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions \n",
      ", and imagined capable of pitiful resentment . A dinner \n",
      "there must be . After Emma had talked about it \n",
      "for ten minutes , Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , \n",
      "and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at \n",
      "the bottom of the table himself , with the usual \n",
      "regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him \n",
      ". The persons to be invited , required little thought \n",
      ". Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons \n",
      "and Mr. Knightley ; so far it was all of \n",
      "course -- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor \n",
      "little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth : \n",
      "-- but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction \n",
      ", and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by \n",
      "Harriet 's begging to be allowed to decline it . \n",
      "`` She would rather not be in his company more \n",
      "than she could help . She was not yet quite \n",
      "able to see him and his charming happy wife together \n",
      ", without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not \n",
      "be displeased , she would rather stay at home . \n",
      "'' It was precisely what Emma would have wished , \n",
      "had she deemed it possible enough for wishing . She \n",
      "was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- \n",
      "for fortitude she knew it was in her to give \n",
      "up being in company and stay at home ; and \n",
      "she could now invite the very person whom she really \n",
      "wanted to make the eighth , Jane Fairfax. -- Since \n",
      "her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , \n",
      "she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had \n",
      "often been. -- Mr . Knightley 's words dwelt with \n",
      "her . He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions \n",
      "from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her . `` \n",
      "This is very true , '' said she , `` \n",
      "at least as far as relates to me , which \n",
      "was all that was meant -- and it is very \n",
      "shameful. -- Of the same age -- and always knowing \n",
      "her -- I ought to have been more her friend. \n",
      "-- She will never like me now . I have \n",
      "neglected her too long . But I will shew her \n",
      "greater attention than I have done . '' Every invitation \n",
      "was successful . They were all disengaged and all happy. \n",
      "-- The preparatory interest of this dinner , however , \n",
      "was not yet over . A circumstance rather unlucky occurred \n",
      ". The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay \n",
      "their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in \n",
      "the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them \n",
      ", and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which \n",
      "one day would be the very day of this party. \n",
      "-- His professional engagements did not allow of his being \n",
      "put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed \n",
      "by its happening so . Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons \n",
      "at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could \n",
      "bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and \n",
      "Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much \n",
      "out of humour at not being able to come even \n",
      "to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a \n",
      "dinner-party . She comforted her father better than she could \n",
      "comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would \n",
      "make them nine , yet he always said so little \n",
      ", that the increase of noise would be very immaterial \n",
      ". She thought it in reality a sad exchange for \n",
      "herself , to have him with his grave looks and \n",
      "reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother . \n",
      "The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to \n",
      "Emma . John Knightley came ; but Mr. Weston was \n",
      "unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the \n",
      "very day . He might be able to join them \n",
      "in the evening , but certainly not to dinner . \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing \n",
      "him so , with the arrival of the little boys \n",
      "and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his \n",
      "fate , removed the chief of even Emma 's vexation \n",
      ". The day came , the party were punctually assembled \n",
      ", and Mr. John Knightley seemed early to devote himself \n",
      "to the business of being agreeable . Instead of drawing \n",
      "his brother off to a window while they waited for \n",
      "dinner , he was talking to Miss Fairfax . Mrs. \n",
      "Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make \n",
      "her , he looked at in silence -- wanting only \n",
      "to observe enough for Isabella 's information -- but Miss \n",
      "Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , \n",
      "and he could talk to her . He had met \n",
      "her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk \n",
      "with his little boys , when it had been just \n",
      "beginning to rain . It was natural to have some \n",
      "civil hopes on the subject , and he said , \n",
      "'' I hope you did not venture far , Miss \n",
      "Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you \n",
      "must have been wet. -- We scarcely got home in \n",
      "time . I hope you turned directly . '' `` \n",
      "I went only to the post-office , '' said she \n",
      ", `` and reached home before the rain was much \n",
      ". It is my daily errand . I always fetch \n",
      "the letters when I am here . It saves trouble \n",
      ", and is a something to get me out . \n",
      "A walk before breakfast does me good . '' `` \n",
      "Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine \n",
      ". '' `` No , but it did not absolutely \n",
      "rain when I set out . '' Mr. John Knightley \n",
      "smiled , and replied , '' That is to say \n",
      ", you chose to have your walk , for you \n",
      "were not six yards from your own door when I \n",
      "had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and \n",
      "John had seen more drops than they could count long \n",
      "before . The post-office has a great charm at one \n",
      "period of our lives . When you have lived to \n",
      "my age , you will begin to think letters are \n",
      "never worth going through the rain for . '' There \n",
      "was a little blush , and then this answer , \n",
      "'' I must not hope to be ever situated as \n",
      "you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion \n",
      ", and therefore I can not expect that simply growing \n",
      "older should make me indifferent about letters . '' `` \n",
      "Indifferent ! Oh ! no -- I never conceived you \n",
      "could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference \n",
      "; they are generally a very positive curse . '' \n",
      "`` You are speaking of letters of business ; mine \n",
      "are letters of friendship . '' `` I have often \n",
      "thought them the worst of the two , '' replied \n",
      "he coolly . `` Business , you know , may \n",
      "bring money , but friendship hardly ever does . '' \n",
      "`` Ah ! you are not serious now . I \n",
      "know Mr. John Knightley too well -- I am very \n",
      "sure he understands the value of friendship as well as \n",
      "any body . I can easily believe that letters are \n",
      "very little to you , much less than to me \n",
      ", but it is not your being ten years older \n",
      "than myself which makes the difference , it is not \n",
      "age , but situation . You have every body dearest \n",
      "to you always at hand , I , probably , \n",
      "never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived \n",
      "all my affections , a post-office , I think , \n",
      "must always have power to draw me out , in \n",
      "worse weather than to-day . '' `` When I talked \n",
      "of your being altered by time , by the progress \n",
      "of years , '' said John Knightley , `` I \n",
      "meant to imply the change of situation which time usually \n",
      "brings . I consider one as including the other . \n",
      "Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not \n",
      "within the daily circle -- but that is not the \n",
      "change I had in view for you . As an \n",
      "old friend , you will allow me to hope , \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have \n",
      "as many concentrated objects as I have . '' It \n",
      "was kindly said , and very far from giving offence \n",
      ". A pleasant '' thank you '' seemed meant to \n",
      "laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering \n",
      "lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that \n",
      "it was felt beyond a laugh . Her attention was \n",
      "now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse , who being , according \n",
      "to his custom on such occasions , making the circle \n",
      "of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to \n",
      "the ladies , was ending with her -- and with \n",
      "all his mildest urbanity , said , '' I am \n",
      "very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your \n",
      "being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies \n",
      "should take care of themselves. -- Young ladies are delicate \n",
      "plants . They should take care of their health and \n",
      "their complexion . My dear , did you change your \n",
      "stockings ? '' `` Yes , sir , I did \n",
      "indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your \n",
      "kind solicitude about me . '' `` My dear Miss \n",
      "Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared \n",
      "for. -- I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are \n",
      "well . They are some of my very old friends \n",
      ". I wish my health allowed me to be a \n",
      "better neighbour . You do us a great deal of \n",
      "honour to-day , I am sure . My daughter and \n",
      "I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and \n",
      "have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . \n",
      "'' The kind-hearted , polite old man might then sit \n",
      "down and feel that he had done his duty , \n",
      "and made every fair lady welcome and easy . By \n",
      "this time , the walk in the rain had reached \n",
      "Mrs. Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane \n",
      ". `` My dear Jane , what is this I \n",
      "hear ? -- Going to the post-office in the rain \n",
      "! -- This must not be , I assure you. \n",
      "-- You sad girl , how could you do such \n",
      "a thing ? -- It is a sign I was \n",
      "not there to take care of you . '' Jane \n",
      "very patiently assured her that she had not caught any \n",
      "cold . `` Oh ! do not tell _me_ . \n",
      "You really are a very sad girl , and do \n",
      "not know how to take care of yourself. -- To \n",
      "the post-office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever \n",
      "hear the like ? You and I must positively exert \n",
      "our authority . '' `` My advice , '' said \n",
      "Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively , `` I certainly do \n",
      "feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must \n",
      "not run such risks. -- Liable as you have been \n",
      "to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly \n",
      "careful , especially at this time of year . The \n",
      "spring I always think requires more than common care . \n",
      "Better wait an hour or two , or even half \n",
      "a day for your letters , than run the risk \n",
      "of bringing on your cough again . Now do not \n",
      "you feel that you had ? Yes , I am \n",
      "sure you are much too reasonable . You look as \n",
      "if you would not do such a thing again . \n",
      "'' `` Oh ! she _shall_ _not_ do such a \n",
      "thing again , '' eagerly rejoined Mrs. Elton . `` \n",
      "We will not allow her to do such a thing \n",
      "again : '' -- and nodding significantly -- '' there \n",
      "must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . \n",
      "I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches \n",
      "our letters every morning ( one of our men , \n",
      "I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too \n",
      "and bring them to you . That will obviate all \n",
      "difficulties you know ; and from _us_ I really think \n",
      ", my dear Jane , you can have no scruple \n",
      "to accept such an accommodation . '' `` You are \n",
      "extremely kind , '' said Jane ; `` but I \n",
      "can not give up my early walk . I am \n",
      "advised to be out of doors as much as I \n",
      "can , I must walk somewhere , and the post-office \n",
      "is an object ; and upon my word , I \n",
      "have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . '' \n",
      "`` My dear Jane , say no more about it \n",
      ". The thing is determined , that is ( laughing \n",
      "affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine \n",
      "any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master \n",
      ". You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I \n",
      "must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I \n",
      "do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my \n",
      "influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet \n",
      "with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as \n",
      "settled . '' `` Excuse me , '' said Jane \n",
      "earnestly , `` I can not by any means consent \n",
      "to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your \n",
      "servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to \n",
      "me , it could be done , as it always \n",
      "is when I am not here , by my grandmama \n",
      "'s . '' `` Oh ! my dear ; but \n",
      "so much as Patty has to do ! -- And \n",
      "it is a kindness to employ our men . '' \n",
      "Jane looked as if she did not mean to be \n",
      "conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking \n",
      "again to Mr. John Knightley . `` The post-office is \n",
      "a wonderful establishment ! '' said she. -- '' The \n",
      "regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of \n",
      "all that it has to do , and all that \n",
      "it does so well , it is really astonishing ! \n",
      "'' `` It is certainly very well regulated . '' \n",
      "`` So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! \n",
      "So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that \n",
      "are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried \n",
      "wrong -- and not one in a million , I \n",
      "suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the \n",
      "variety of hands , and of bad hands too , \n",
      "that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder \n",
      ". '' `` The clerks grow expert from habit. -- \n",
      "They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand \n",
      ", and exercise improves them . If you want any \n",
      "farther explanation , '' continued he , smiling , `` \n",
      "they are paid for it . That is the key \n",
      "to a great deal of capacity . The public pays \n",
      "and must be served well . '' The varieties of \n",
      "handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations \n",
      "made . `` I have heard it asserted , '' \n",
      "said John Knightley , `` that the same sort of \n",
      "handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the \n",
      "same master teaches , it is natural enough . But \n",
      "for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must \n",
      "be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have \n",
      "very little teaching after an early age , and scramble \n",
      "into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma \n",
      ", I think , do write very much alike . \n",
      "I have not always known their writing apart . '' \n",
      "`` Yes , '' said his brother hesitatingly , `` \n",
      "there is a likeness . I know what you mean \n",
      "-- but Emma 's hand is the strongest . '' \n",
      "`` Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , '' said \n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse ; '' and always did . And so \n",
      "does poor Mrs. Weston '' -- with half a sigh \n",
      "and half a smile at her . `` I never \n",
      "saw any gentleman 's handwriting '' -- Emma began , \n",
      "looking also at Mrs. Weston ; but stopped , on \n",
      "perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending to some one else \n",
      "-- and the pause gave her time to reflect , \n",
      "'' Now , how am I going to introduce him \n",
      "? -- Am I unequal to speaking his name at \n",
      "once before all these people ? Is it necessary for \n",
      "me to use any roundabout phrase ? -- Your Yorkshire \n",
      "friend -- your correspondent in Yorkshire ; -- that would \n",
      "be the way , I suppose , if I were \n",
      "very bad. -- No , I can pronounce his name \n",
      "without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and \n",
      "better. -- Now for it . '' Mrs. Weston was \n",
      "disengaged and Emma began again -- '' Mr. Frank Churchill \n",
      "writes one of the best gentleman 's hands I ever \n",
      "saw . '' `` I do not admire it , \n",
      "'' said Mr. Knightley . `` It is too small \n",
      "-- wants strength . It is like a woman 's \n",
      "writing . '' This was not submitted to by either \n",
      "lady . They vindicated him against the base aspersion . \n",
      "`` No , it by no means wanted strength -- \n",
      "it was not a large hand , but very clear \n",
      "and certainly strong . Had not Mrs. Weston any letter \n",
      "about her to produce ? '' No , she had \n",
      "heard from him very lately , but having answered the \n",
      "letter , had put it away . `` If we \n",
      "were in the other room , '' said Emma , \n",
      "`` if I had my writing-desk , I am sure \n",
      "I could produce a specimen . I have a note \n",
      "of his. -- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston \n",
      ", employing him to write for you one day ? \n",
      "'' `` He chose to say he was employed '' \n",
      "-- '' Well , well , I have that note \n",
      "; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr \n",
      ". Knightley . '' `` Oh ! when a gallant \n",
      "young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , '' said \n",
      "Mr. Knightley dryly , `` writes to a fair lady \n",
      "like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , \n",
      "put forth his best . '' Dinner was on table. \n",
      "-- Mrs . Elton , before she could be spoken \n",
      "to , was ready ; and before Mr. Woodhouse had \n",
      "reached her with his request to be allowed to hand \n",
      "her into the dining-parlour , was saying -- '' Must \n",
      "I go first ? I really am ashamed of always \n",
      "leading the way . '' Jane 's solicitude about fetching \n",
      "her own letters had not escaped Emma . She had \n",
      "heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity \n",
      "to know whether the wet walk of this morning had \n",
      "produced any . She suspected that it _had_ ; that \n",
      "it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in \n",
      "full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , \n",
      "and that it had not been in vain . She \n",
      "thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual \n",
      "-- a glow both of complexion and spirits . She \n",
      "could have made an inquiry or two , as to \n",
      "the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails ; \n",
      "-- it was at her tongue 's end -- but \n",
      "she abstained . She was quite determined not to utter \n",
      "a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax 's feelings ; \n",
      "and they followed the other ladies out of the room \n",
      ", arm in arm , with an appearance of good-will \n",
      "highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each . \n",
      "CHAPTER XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after \n",
      "dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their \n",
      "making two distinct parties ; -- with so much perseverance \n",
      "in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane \n",
      "Fairfax and slight herself . She and Mrs. Weston were \n",
      "obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent \n",
      "together . Mrs. Elton left them no choice . If \n",
      "Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon \n",
      "began again ; and though much that passed between them \n",
      "was in a half-whisper , especially on Mrs. Elton 's \n",
      "side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their \n",
      "principal subjects : The post-office -- catching cold -- fetching \n",
      "letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; \n",
      "and to them succeeded one , which must be at \n",
      "least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had \n",
      "yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , \n",
      "and professions of Mrs. Elton 's meditated activity . `` \n",
      "Here is April come ! '' said she , `` \n",
      "I get quite anxious about you . June will soon \n",
      "be here . '' `` But I have never fixed \n",
      "on June or any other month -- merely looked forward \n",
      "to the summer in general . '' `` But have \n",
      "you really heard of nothing ? '' `` I have \n",

      "Elton , who can have thought of it as I \n",
      "have done ? '' `` But you have not seen \n",
      "so much of the world as I have . You \n",

      "that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove . A cousin \n",

      "`` Thank you , but I would rather you did \n",

      "obliged to any body who feels for me , but \n",
      "I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done \n",
      "till the summer . For two or three months longer \n",
      "I shall remain where I am , and as I \n",
      "am . '' `` And I am quite serious too \n",

      "nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . '' In this \n",
      "style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any \n",
      "thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room ; her \n",
      "vanity had then a change of object , and Emma \n",
      "heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane , \n",
      "'' Here comes this dear old beau of mine , \n",
      "I protest ! -- Only think of his gallantry in \n",
      "coming away before the other men ! -- what a \n",
      "dear creature he is ; -- I assure you I \n",
      "like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , \n",
      "old-fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste \n",
      "than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . \n",
      "But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you \n",
      "had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . \n",
      "Oh ! I assure you I began to think my \n",
      "caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I \n",
      "am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my \n",
      "gown . How do you like it ? -- Selina \n",
      "'s choice -- handsome , I think , but I \n",
      "do not know whether it is not over-trimmed ; I \n",
      "have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed \n",
      "-- quite a horror of finery . I must put \n",
      "on a few ornaments now , because it is expected \n",
      "of me . A bride , you know , must \n",
      "appear like a bride , but my natural taste is \n",
      "all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is \n",
      "so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite \n",
      "in the minority , I believe ; few people seem \n",
      "to value simplicity of dress , -- show and finery \n",
      "are every thing . I have some notion of putting \n",
      "such a trimming as this to my white and silver \n",
      "poplin . Do you think it will look well ? \n",
      "'' The whole party were but just reassembled in the \n",
      "drawing-room when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them . \n",
      "He had returned to a late dinner , and walked \n",
      "to Hartfield as soon as it was over . He \n",
      "had been too much expected by the best judges , \n",
      "for surprize -- but there was great joy . Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , \n",
      "as he would have been sorry to see him before \n",
      ". John Knightley only was in mute astonishment. -- That \n",
      "a man who might have spent his evening quietly at \n",
      "home after a day of business in London , should \n",
      "set off again , and walk half a mile to \n",
      "another man 's house , for the sake of being \n",
      "in mixed company till bed-time , of finishing his day \n",
      "in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers \n",
      ", was a circumstance to strike him deeply . A \n",
      "man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in \n",
      "the morning , and might now have been still , \n",
      "who had been long talking , and might have been \n",
      "silent , who had been in more than one crowd \n",
      ", and might have been alone ! -- Such a \n",
      "man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his \n",
      "own fireside , and on the evening of a cold \n",
      "sleety April day rush out again into the world ! \n",
      "-- Could he by a touch of his finger have \n",
      "instantly taken back his wife , there would have been \n",
      "a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather \n",
      "than break up the party . John Knightley looked at \n",
      "him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and \n",
      "said , '' I could not have believed it even \n",
      "of _him_ . '' Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious \n",
      "of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful \n",
      "as usual , and with all the right of being \n",
      "principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home \n",
      "confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; \n",
      "and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to \n",
      "his dinner , convincing her that none of all her \n",
      "careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and \n",
      "spread abroad what public news he had heard , was \n",
      "proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally \n",
      "addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest \n",
      "doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the \n",
      "room . He gave her a letter , it was \n",
      "from Frank , and to herself ; he had met \n",
      "with it in his way , and had taken the \n",
      "liberty of opening it . `` Read it , read \n",
      "it , '' said he , `` it will give \n",
      "you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not \n",
      "take you long ; read it to Emma . '' \n",
      "The two ladies looked over it together ; and he \n",
      "sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , \n",
      "in a voice a little subdued , but very audible \n",
      "to every body . `` Well , he is coming \n",

      "Well , what do you say to it ? -- \n",

      "you would not believe me ? -- In town next \n",
      "week , you see -- at the latest , I \n",
      "dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the \n",
      "black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; \n",
      "most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday . \n",
      "As to her illness , all nothing of course . \n",
      "But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among \n",
      "us again , so near as town . They will \n",
      "stay a good while when they do come , and \n",
      "he will be half his time with us . This \n",
      "is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good \n",
      "news , is not it ? Have you finished it \n",
      "? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up \n",
      ", put it up ; we will have a good \n",
      "talk about it some other time , but it will \n",
      "not do now . I shall only just mention the \n",
      "circumstance to the others in a common way . '' \n",
      "Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion . \n",
      "Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them . \n",
      "She was happy , she knew she was happy , \n",
      "and knew she ought to be happy . Her congratulations \n",
      "were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak \n",
      "so fluently . _She_ was a little occupied in weighing \n",
      "her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree \n",
      "of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable \n",
      ". Mr. Weston , however , too eager to be \n",
      "very observant , too communicative to want others to talk \n",
      ", was very well satisfied with what she did say \n",
      ", and soon moved away to make the rest of \n",
      "his friends happy by a partial communication of what the \n",
      "whole room must have overheard already . It was well \n",
      "that he took every body 's joy for granted , \n",
      "or he might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or \n",
      "Mr. Knightley particularly delighted . They were the first entitled \n",
      ", after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made \n",
      "happy ; -- from them he would have proceeded to \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation \n",
      "with John Knightley , that it would have been too \n",
      "positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. \n",
      "Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began \n",
      "on the subject with her . CHAPTER XVIII '' I \n",
      "hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my \n",
      "son to you , '' said Mr. Weston . Mrs. \n",
      "Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended \n",
      "her by such a hope , smiled most graciously . \n",
      "`` You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , \n",
      "I presume , '' he continued -- '' and know \n",
      "him to be my son , though he does not \n",
      "bear my name . '' `` Oh ! yes , \n",
      "and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . \n",
      "I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in \n",
      "calling on him ; and we shall both have great \n",
      "pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . '' `` \n",
      "You are very obliging. -- Frank will be extremely happy \n",
      ", I am sure. -- He is to be in \n",
      "town next week , if not sooner . We have \n",
      "notice of it in a letter to-day . I met \n",
      "the letters in my way this morning , and seeing \n",
      "my son 's hand , presumed to open it -- \n",
      "though it was not directed to me -- it was \n",
      "to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , \n",
      "I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter \n",
      ". '' `` And so you absolutely opened what was \n",
      "directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston -- ( \n",
      "laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that. -- A \n",
      "most dangerous precedent indeed ! -- I beg you will \n",
      "not let your neighbours follow your example. -- Upon my \n",
      "word , if this is what I am to expect \n",
      ", we married women must begin to exert ourselves ! \n",
      "-- Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have \n",
      "believed it of you ! '' `` Aye , we \n",
      "men are sad fellows . You must take care of \n",
      "yourself , Mrs . Elton. -- This letter tells us \n",
      "-- it is a short letter -- written in a \n",
      "hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells \n",
      "us that they are all coming up to town directly \n",
      ", on Mrs. Churchill 's account -- she has not \n",
      "been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too \n",
      "cold for her -- so they are all to move \n",
      "southward without loss of time . '' `` Indeed ! \n",
      "-- from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in \n",
      "Yorkshire ? '' `` Yes , they are about one \n",
      "hundred and ninety miles from London . a considerable journey \n",
      ". '' `` Yes , upon my word , very \n",
      "considerable . Sixty-five miles farther than from Maple Grove to \n",
      "London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , \n",
      "to people of large fortune ? -- You would be \n",
      "amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , \n",
      "sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me -- \n",
      "but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went \n",
      "to London and back again with four horses . '' \n",
      "`` The evil of the distance from Enscombe , '' \n",
      "said Mr. Weston , `` is , that Mrs. Churchill \n",
      ", _as_ _we_ _understand_ , has not been able to \n",
      "leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank \n",
      "'s last letter she complained , he said , of \n",
      "being too weak to get into her conservatory without having \n",
      "both his arm and his uncle 's ! This , \n",
      "you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- \n",
      "but now she is so impatient to be in town \n",
      ", that she means to sleep only two nights on \n",
      "the road. -- So Frank writes word . Certainly , \n",
      "delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . \n",
      "You must grant me that . '' `` No , \n",
      "indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I Always \n",
      "take the part of my own sex . I do \n",
      "indeed . I give you notice -- You will find \n",
      "me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always \n",
      "stand up for women -- and I assure you , \n",
      "if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping \n",
      "at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. \n",
      "Churchill's making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says \n",
      "it is quite horror to her -- and I believe \n",
      "I have caught a little of her nicety . She \n",
      "always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution \n",
      ". Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? '' `` \n",
      "Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that \n",
      "any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will \n",
      "not be second to any lady in the land for \n",
      "'' -- Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with , '' Oh \n",
      "! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me . Selina \n",
      "is no fine lady , I assure you . Do \n",
      "not run away with such an idea . '' `` \n",
      "Is not she ? Then she is no rule for \n",
      "Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady \n",
      "as any body ever beheld . '' Mrs. Elton began \n",
      "to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly \n",
      ". It was by no means her object to have \n",
      "it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady \n",
      "; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence \n",
      "of it ; -- and she was considering in what \n",
      "way she had best retract , when Mr. Weston went \n",
      "on . `` Mrs. Churchill is not much in my \n",
      "good graces , as you may suspect -- but this \n",
      "is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of \n",
      "Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of \n",
      "her . Besides , she is out of health now \n",
      "; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , \n",
      "she has always been . I would not say so \n",
      "to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have \n",
      "not much faith in Mrs. Churchill 's illness . '' \n",
      "`` If she is really ill , why not go \n",
      "to Bath , Mr . Weston ? -- To Bath \n",
      ", or to Clifton ? '' `` She has taken \n",
      "it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for \n",
      "her . The fact is , I suppose , that \n",
      "she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been \n",
      "a longer time stationary there , than she ever was \n",
      "before , and she begins to want change . It \n",
      "is a retired place . A fine place , but \n",
      "very retired . '' `` Aye -- like Maple Grove \n",
      ", I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired \n",
      "from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense \n",
      "plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from \n",
      "every thing -- in the most complete retirement. -- And \n",
      "Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina \n",
      "to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps \n",
      "she may not have resources enough in herself to be \n",
      "qualified for a country life . I always say a \n",
      "woman can not have too many resources -- and I \n",
      "feel very thankful that I have so many myself as \n",
      "to be quite independent of society . '' `` Frank \n",
      "was here in February for a fortnight . '' `` \n",
      "So I remember to have heard . He will find \n",
      "an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes \n",
      "again ; that is , if I may presume to \n",
      "call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never \n",
      "have heard of there being such a creature in the \n",
      "world . '' This was too loud a call for \n",
      "a compliment to be passed by , and Mr. Weston \n",
      ", with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed , \n",
      "'' My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine \n",
      "such a thing possible . Not heard of you ! \n",
      "-- I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full \n",
      "of very little else than Mrs . Elton . '' \n",
      "He had done his duty and could return to his \n",
      "son . `` When Frank left us , '' continued \n",
      "he , `` it was quite uncertain when we might \n",
      "see him again , which makes this day 's news \n",
      "doubly welcome . It has been completely unexpected . That \n",
      "is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would \n",
      "be here again soon , I was sure something favourable \n",
      "would turn up -- but nobody believed me . He \n",
      "and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` How \n",
      "could he contrive to come ? And how could it \n",
      "be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him \n",
      "again ? ' and so forth -- I always felt \n",
      "that something would happen in our favour ; and so \n",
      "it has , you see . I have observed , \n",
      "Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , \n",
      "that if things are going untowardly one month , they \n",
      "are sure to mend the next . '' `` Very \n",
      "true , Mr. Weston , perfectly true . It is \n",
      "just what I used to say to a certain gentleman \n",
      "in company in the days of courtship , when , \n",
      "because things did not go quite right , did not \n",
      "proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , \n",
      "he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim \n",
      "that he was sure at this rate it would be \n",
      "_May_ before Hymen 's saffron robe would be put on \n",
      "for us . Oh ! the pains I have been \n",
      "at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller \n",
      "views ! The carriage -- we had disappointments about the \n",
      "carriage ; -- one morning , I remember , he \n",
      "came to me quite in despair . '' She was \n",
      "stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr. \n",
      "Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on . `` \n",
      "You were mentioning May . May is the very month \n",
      "which Mrs. Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself \n",
      ", to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe -- \n",
      "in short , to spend in London ; so that \n",
      "we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank \n",
      "the whole spring -- precisely the season of the year \n",
      "which one should have chosen for it : days almost \n",
      "at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always \n",
      "inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise \n",
      ". When he was here before , we made the \n",
      "best of it ; but there was a good deal \n",
      "of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always \n",
      "is in February , you know , and we could \n",
      "not do half that we intended . Now will be \n",
      "the time . This will be complete enjoyment ; and \n",
      "I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the \n",
      "uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation \n",
      "there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow \n",
      ", and at any hour , may not be more \n",
      "friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house \n",
      ". I think it is so . I think it \n",
      "is the state of mind which gives most spirit and \n",

      "He is generally thought a fine young man , but \n",
      "do not expect a prodigy . Mrs. Weston 's partiality \n",
      "for him is very great , and , as you \n",
      "may suppose , most gratifying to me . She thinks \n",
      "nobody equal to him . '' `` And I assure \n",
      "you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt \n",
      "that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . \n",
      "I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank \n",
      "Churchill. -- At the same time it is fair to \n",

      "helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and \n",
      "insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , \n",
      "she has no fair pretence of family or blood . \n",
      "She was nobody when he married her , barely the \n",

      "I assure you , she is an upstart . '' \n",
      "`` Only think ! well , that must be infinitely \n",
      "provoking ! I have quite a horror of upstarts . \n",
      "Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people \n",
      "of that sort ; for there is a family in \n",
      "that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother \n",
      "and sister from the airs they give themselves ! Your \n",
      "description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly \n",
      ". People of the name of Tupman , very lately \n",
      "settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , \n",
      "but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be \n",
      "on a footing with the old established families . A \n",
      "year and a half is the very utmost that they \n",
      "can have lived at West Hall ; and how they \n",
      "got their fortune nobody knows . They came from Birmingham \n",
      ", which is not a place to promise much , \n",
      "you know , Mr. Weston . One has not great \n",
      "hopes from Birmingham . I always say there is something \n",
      "direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively \n",
      "known of the Tupmans , though a good many things \n",
      "I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their \n",
      "manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother \n",
      ", Mr. Suckling , who happens to be one of \n",
      "their nearest neighbours . It is infinitely too bad . \n",
      "Mr. Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident \n",
      "at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before \n",
      "him -- I believe , at least -- I am \n",
      "almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase \n",
      "before his death . '' They were interrupted . Tea \n",
      "was carrying round , and Mr. Weston , having said \n",
      "all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of \n",
      "walking away . After tea , Mr. and Mrs. Weston \n",
      ", and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse to \n",
      "cards . The remaining five were left to their own \n",
      "powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well \n",
      "; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; \n",
      "Mrs. Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination \n",
      "to pay , and she was herself in a worry \n",
      "of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent \n",
      ". Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother \n",
      ". He was to leave them early the next day \n",
      "; and he soon began with -- '' Well , \n",
      "Emma , I do not believe I have any thing \n",
      "more to say about the boys ; but you have \n",
      "your sister 's letter , and every thing is down \n",
      "at full length there we may be sure . My \n",
      "charge would be much more concise than her 's , \n",
      "and probably not much in the same spirit ; all \n",
      "that I have to recommend being comprised in , do \n",
      "not spoil them , and do not physic them . \n",
      "'' `` I rather hope to satisfy you both , \n",
      "'' said Emma , `` for I shall do all \n",
      "in my power to make them happy , which will \n",
      "be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false \n",
      "indulgence and physic . '' `` And if you find \n",
      "them troublesome , you must send them home again . \n",
      "'' `` That is very likely . You think so \n",
      ", do not you ? '' `` I hope I \n",
      "am aware that they may be too noisy for your \n",
      "father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you \n",
      ", if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much \n",
      "as they have done lately . '' `` Increase ! \n",
      "'' `` Certainly ; you must be sensible that the \n",
      "last half-year has made a great difference in your way \n",
      "of life . '' `` Difference ! No indeed I \n",
      "am not . '' `` There can be no doubt \n",
      "of your being much more engaged with company than you \n",
      "used to be . Witness this very time . Here \n",
      "am I come down for only one day , and \n",
      "you are engaged with a dinner-party ! -- When did \n",
      "it happen before , or any thing like it ? \n",
      "Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with \n",
      "it . A little while ago , every letter to \n",
      "Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at \n",
      "Mr. Cole 's , or balls at the Crown . \n",
      "The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your \n",
      "goings-on , is very great . '' `` Yes , \n",
      "'' said his brother quickly , `` it is Randalls \n",
      "that does it all . '' `` Very well -- \n",
      "and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely \n",
      "to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me \n",
      "as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and \n",
      "John may be sometimes in the way . And if \n",
      "they are , I only beg you to send them \n",
      "home . '' `` No , '' cried Mr. Knightley \n",
      ", `` that need not be the consequence . Let \n",
      "them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be \n",
      "at leisure . '' `` Upon my word , '' \n",
      "exclaimed Emma , `` you amuse me ! I should \n",
      "like to know how many of all my numerous engagements \n",
      "take place without your being of the party ; and \n",
      "why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting \n",
      "leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing \n",
      "engagements of mine -- what have they been ? Dining \n",
      "once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked \n",
      "of , which never took place . I can understand \n",
      "you -- ( nodding at Mr. John Knightley ) -- \n",
      "your good fortune in meeting with so many of your \n",
      "friends at once here , delights you too much to \n",
      "pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom \n",
      "I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you \n",
      "should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , \n",
      "I can not imagine . And as to my dear \n",
      "little boys , I must say , that if Aunt \n",
      "Emma has not time for them , I do not \n",
      "think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , \n",
      "who is absent from home about five hours where she \n",
      "is absent one -- and who , when he is \n",
      "at home , is either reading to himself or settling \n",
      "his accounts . '' Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying \n",
      "not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon \n",
      "Mrs. Elton 's beginning to talk to him . VOLUME \n",
      "III CHAPTER I A very little quiet reflection was enough \n",
      "to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation \n",
      "on hearing this news of Frank Churchill . She was \n",
      "soon convinced that it was not for herself she was \n",
      "feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for \n",
      "him . Her own attachment had really subsided into a \n",
      "mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ; \n",
      "-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always \n",
      "so much the most in love of the two , \n",
      "were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment \n",
      "which he had taken away , it would be very \n",
      "distressing . If a separation of two months should not \n",
      "have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before \n",
      "her : -- caution for him and for herself would \n",
      "be necessary . She did not mean to have her \n",
      "own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent \n",
      "on her to avoid any encouragement of his . She \n",
      "wished she might be able to keep him from an \n",
      "absolute declaration . That would be so very painful a \n",
      "conclusion of their present acquaintance ! and yet , she \n",
      "could not help rather anticipating something decisive . She felt \n",
      "as if the spring would not pass without bringing a \n",
      "crisis , an event , a something to alter her \n",
      "present composed and tranquil state . It was not very \n",
      "long , though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen \n",
      ", before she had the power of forming some opinion \n",
      "of Frank Churchill's feelings . The Enscombe family were not \n",
      "in town quite so soon as had been imagined , \n",
      "but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards . He \n",
      "rode down for a couple of hours ; he could \n",
      "not yet do more ; but as he came from \n",
      "Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all \n",
      "her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was \n",
      "influenced , and how she must act . They met \n",
      "with the utmost friendliness . There could be no doubt \n",
      "of his great pleasure in seeing her . But she \n",
      "had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her \n",
      "as he had done , of his feeling the same \n",
      "tenderness in the same degree . She watched him well \n",
      ". It was a clear thing he was less in \n",
      "love than he had been . Absence , with the \n",
      "conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very \n",
      "natural and very desirable effect . He was in high \n",
      "spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever \n",
      ", and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit \n",
      ", and recur to old stories : and he was \n",
      "not without agitation . It was not in his calmness \n",
      "that she read his comparative difference . He was not \n",
      "calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was \n",
      "restlessness about him . Lively as he was , it \n",
      "seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but \n",
      "what decided her belief on the subject , was his \n",
      "staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying \n",
      "away to make other calls in Highbury . `` He \n",
      "had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street \n",
      "as he passed -- he had not stopped , he \n",
      "would not stop for more than a word -- but \n",
      "he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed \n",
      "if he did not call , and much as he \n",
      "wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry \n",
      "off . '' She had no doubt as to his \n",
      "being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits \n",
      ", nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect \n",
      "cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it \n",
      "implied a dread of her returning power , and a \n",
      "discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long . \n",
      "This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the \n",
      "course of ten days . He was often hoping , \n",
      "intending to come -- but was always prevented . His \n",
      "aunt could not bear to have him leave her . \n",
      "Such was his own account at Randall 's . If \n",
      "he were quite sincere , if he really tried to \n",
      "come , it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill \n",
      "'s removal to London had been of no service to \n",
      "the wilful or nervous part of her disorder . That \n",
      "she was really ill was very certain ; he had \n",
      "declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls . Though \n",
      "much might be fancy , he could not doubt , \n",
      "when he looked back , that she was in a \n",
      "weaker state of health than she had been half a \n",
      "year ago . He did not believe it to proceed \n",
      "from any thing that care and medicine might not remove \n",
      ", or at least that she might not have many \n",
      "years of existence before her ; but he could not \n",
      "be prevailed on , by all his father 's doubts \n",
      ", to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , \n",
      "or that she was as strong as ever . It \n",
      "soon appeared that London was not the place for her \n",
      ". She could not endure its noise . Her nerves \n",
      "were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the \n",
      "ten days ' end , her nephew 's letter to \n",
      "Randalls communicated a change of plan . They were going \n",
      "to remove immediately to Richmond . Mrs. Churchill had been \n",
      "recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there \n",
      ", and had otherwise a fancy for the place . \n",
      "A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged , \n",
      "and much benefit expected from the change . Emma heard \n",
      "that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement \n",
      ", and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of \n",
      "having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to \n",
      "many dear friends -- for the house was taken for \n",
      "May and June . She was told that now he \n",
      "wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them \n",
      ", almost as often as he could even wish . \n",
      "Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects . \n",
      "He was considering her as the source of all the \n",
      "happiness they offered . She hoped it was not so \n",
      ". Two months must bring it to the proof . \n",
      "Mr. Weston 's own happiness was indisputable . He was \n",
      "quite delighted . It was the very circumstance he could \n",
      "have wished for . Now , it would be really \n",
      "having Frank in their neighbourhood . What were nine miles \n",
      "to a young man ? -- An hour 's ride \n",
      ". He would be always coming over . The difference \n",
      "in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to \n",
      "make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing \n",
      "him never . Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- \n",
      "it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street -- was a \n",
      "serious obstacle . Were he ever able to get away \n",
      ", the day would be spent in coming and returning \n",
      ". There was no comfort in having him in London \n",
      "; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but \n",
      "Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse . Better \n",
      "than nearer ! One good thing was immediately brought to \n",
      "a certainty by this removal , -- the ball at \n",
      "the Crown . It had not been forgotten before , \n",
      "but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to \n",
      "fix a day . Now , however , it was \n",
      "absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and \n",
      "very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , \n",
      "a few lines from Frank , to say that his \n",
      "aunt felt already much better for the change , and \n",
      "that he had no doubt of being able to join \n",
      "them for twenty-four hours at any given time , induced \n",
      "them to name as early a day as possible . \n",
      "Mr. Weston 's ball was to be a real thing \n",
      ". A very few to-morrows stood between the young people \n",
      "of Highbury and happiness . Mr. Woodhouse was resigned . \n",
      "The time of year lightened the evil to him . \n",
      "May was better for every thing than February . Mrs. \n",
      "Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , \n",
      "James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that \n",
      "neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have \n",
      "any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma \n",
      "were gone . CHAPTER II No misfortune occurred , again \n",
      "to prevent the ball . The day approached , the \n",
      "day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious \n",
      "watching , Frank Churchill , in all the certainty of \n",
      "his own self , reached Randalls before dinner , and \n",
      "every thing was safe . No second meeting had there \n",
      "yet been between him and Emma . The room at \n",
      "the Crown was to witness it ; -- but it \n",
      "would be better than a common meeting in a crowd \n",
      ". Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his \n",
      "entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after \n",
      "themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as \n",
      "to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any \n",
      "other persons came , that she could not refuse him \n",
      ", and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the \n",
      "young man 's company . She was to convey Harriet \n",
      ", and they drove to the Crown in good time \n",
      ", the Randalls party just sufficiently before them . Frank \n",
      "Churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and \n",
      "though he did not say much , his eyes declared \n",
      "that he meant to have a delightful evening . They \n",
      "all walked about together , to see that every thing \n",
      "was as it should be ; and within a few \n",
      "minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage , \n",
      "which Emma could not hear the sound of at first \n",
      ", without great surprize . `` So unreasonably early ! \n",
      "'' she was going to exclaim ; but she presently \n",
      "found that it was a family of old friends , \n",
      "who were coming , like herself , by particular desire \n",
      ", to help Mr. Weston 's judgment ; and they \n",
      "were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins \n",
      ", who had been entreated to come early with the \n",
      "same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that \n",
      "it seemed as if half the company might soon be \n",
      "collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection . Emma \n",
      "perceived that her taste was not the only taste on \n",
      "which Mr. Weston depended , and felt , that to \n",
      "be the favourite and intimate of a man who had \n",
      "so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very \n",
      "first distinction in the scale of vanity . She liked \n",
      "his open manners , but a little less of open-heartedness \n",
      "would have made him a higher character. -- General benevolence \n",
      ", but not general friendship , made a man what \n",
      "he ought to be. -- She could fancy such a \n",
      "man . The whole party walked about , and looked \n",
      ", and praised again ; and then , having nothing \n",
      "else to do , formed a sort of half-circle round \n",
      "the fire , to observe in their various modes , \n",
      "till other subjects were started , that , though _May_ \n",
      ", a fire in the evening was still very pleasant \n",
      ". Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston 's \n",
      "fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet \n",
      "larger . They had stopped at Mrs. Bates 's door \n",
      "to offer the use of their carriage , but the \n",
      "aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons \n",
      ". Frank was standing by her , but not steadily \n",
      "; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind \n",
      "not at ease . He was looking about , he \n",
      "was going to the door , he was watching for \n",
      "the sound of other carriages , -- impatient to begin \n",
      ", or afraid of being always near her . Mrs. \n",
      "Elton was spoken of . `` I think she must \n",
      "be here soon , '' said he . `` I \n",
      "have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I \n",
      "have heard so much of her . It can not \n",
      "be long , I think , before she comes . \n",
      "'' A carriage was heard . He was on the \n",
      "move immediately ; but coming back , said , '' \n",
      "I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her \n",
      ". I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton \n",
      ". I have no business to put myself forward . \n",
      "'' Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared ; and all the \n",
      "smiles and the proprieties passed . `` But Miss Bates \n",
      "and Miss Fairfax ! '' said Mr. Weston , looking \n",
      "about . `` We thought you were to bring them \n",
      ". '' The mistake had been slight . The carriage \n",
      "was sent for them now . Emma longed to know \n",
      "what Frank 's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be \n",
      "; how he was affected by the studied elegance of \n",
      "her dress , and her smiles of graciousness . He \n",
      "was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by \n",
      "giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had \n",
      "passed . In a few minutes the carriage returned. -- \n",
      "Somebody talked of rain. -- '' I will see that \n",
      "there are umbrellas , sir , '' said Frank to \n",
      "his father : '' Miss Bates must not be forgotten \n",
      ": '' and away he went . Mr. Weston was \n",
      "following ; but Mrs. Elton detained him , to gratify \n",
      "him by her opinion of his son ; and so \n",
      "briskly did she begin , that the young man himself \n",
      ", though by no means moving slowly , could hardly \n",
      "be out of hearing . `` A very fine young \n",
      "man indeed , Mr. Weston . You know I candidly \n",
      "told you I should form my own opinion ; and \n",
      "I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased \n",
      "with him. -- You may believe me . I never \n",
      "compliment . I think him a very handsome young man \n",
      ", and his manners are precisely what I like and \n",
      "approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least \n",
      "conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a \n",
      "vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them \n",
      ". They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither \n",
      "Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them \n",
      "; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things \n",
      "! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault \n",
      ", bore with them much better . '' While she \n",
      "talked of his son , Mr. Weston 's attention was \n",
      "chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , \n",
      "he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to \n",
      "be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry \n",
      "away . Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston . `` \n",
      "I have no doubt of its being our carriage with \n",
      "Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are \n",
      "so extremely expeditious ! -- I believe we drive faster \n",
      "than any body. -- What a pleasure it is to \n",
      "send one 's carriage for a friend ! -- I \n",
      "understand you were so kind as to offer , but \n",
      "another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may \n",
      "be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ \n",
      ". '' Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by \n",
      "the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and \n",
      "Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty \n",
      "as Mrs. Weston 's to receive them . Her gestures \n",
      "and movements might be understood by any one who looked \n",
      "on like Emma ; but her words , every body \n",
      "'s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow \n",

      "Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a \n",
      "little way behind her. -- He was thoughtful . Whether \n",
      "he were overhearing too , she could not determine . \n",
      "After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress \n",
      "and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , \n",
      "Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- \n",
      "and it was , `` How do you like my \n",
      "gown ? -- How do you like my trimming ? \n",
      "-- How has Wright done my hair ? '' -- \n",
      "with many other relative questions , all answered with patient \n",
      "politeness . Mrs. Elton then said , '' Nobody can \n",
      "think less of dress in general than I do -- \n",
      "but upon such an occasion as this , when every \n",
      "body 's eyes are so much upon me , and \n",
      "in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no \n",

      "suit. -- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill \n",
      ". I like him very well . '' At this \n",
      "moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could \n",
      "not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , \n",
      "and did not want to hear more ; -- and \n",
      "the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while \n",
      ", till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton 's tones again \n",
      "distinctly forward. -- Mr . Elton had just joined them \n",
      ", and his wife was exclaiming , '' Oh ! \n",
      "you have found us out at last , have you \n",
      ", in our seclusion ? -- I was this moment \n",
      "telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be \n",
      "impatient for tidings of us . '' `` Jane ! \n",
      "'' -- repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of \n",
      "surprize and displeasure. -- '' That is easy -- but \n",
      "Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . \n",
      "'' `` How do you like Mrs . Elton ? \n",
      "'' said Emma in a whisper . `` Not at \n",
      "all . '' `` You are ungrateful . '' `` \n",
      "Ungrateful ! -- What do you mean ? '' Then \n",
      "changing from a frown to a smile -- '' No \n",
      ", do not tell me -- I do not want \n",
      "to know what you mean. -- Where is my father \n",
      "? -- When are we to begin dancing ? '' \n",
      "Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an \n",
      "odd humour . He walked off to find his father \n",
      ", but was quickly back again with both Mr. and \n",
      "Mrs. Weston . He had met with them in a \n",
      "little perplexity , which must be laid before Emma . \n",
      "It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton \n",
      "must be asked to begin the ball ; that she \n",
      "would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes \n",
      "of giving Emma that distinction. -- Emma heard the sad \n",
      "truth with fortitude . `` And what are we to \n",
      "do for a proper partner for her ? '' said \n",
      "Mr. Weston . `` She will think Frank ought to \n",
      "ask her . '' Frank turned instantly to Emma , \n",
      "to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an \n",
      "engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect \n",
      "approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston \n",
      "was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , \n",
      "and that their business was to help to persuade him \n",
      "into it , which was done pretty soon. -- Mr. \n",
      "Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank \n",
      "Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to \n",
      "stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always \n",
      "considered the ball as peculiarly for her . It was \n",
      "almost enough to make her think of marrying . Mrs. \n",
      "Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , \n",
      "in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended \n",
      "to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose \n",
      "by the change . Mr. Weston might be his son \n",
      "'s superior. -- In spite of this little rub , \n",
      "however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to \n",
      "see the respectable length of the set as it was \n",
      "forming , and to feel that she had so many \n",
      "hours of unusual festivity before her. -- She was more \n",
      "disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any \n",
      "thing else. -- There he was , among the standers-by \n",
      ", where he ought not to be ; he ought \n",
      "to be dancing , -- not classing himself with the \n",
      "husbands , and fathers , and whist-players , who were \n",
      "pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their \n",
      "rubbers were made up , -- so young as he \n",
      "looked ! -- He could not have appeared to greater \n",
      "advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself \n",
      ". His tall , firm , upright figure , among \n",
      "the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men \n",
      ", was such as Emma felt must draw every body \n",
      "'s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , \n",
      "there was not one among the whole row of young \n",
      "men who could be compared with him. -- He moved \n",
      "a few steps nearer , and those few steps were \n",
      "enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with \n",
      "what natural grace , he must have danced , would \n",
      "he but take the trouble. -- Whenever she caught his \n",
      "eye , she forced him to smile ; but in \n",
      "general he was looking grave . She wished he could \n",
      "love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill \n",
      "better. -- He seemed often observing her . She must \n",
      "not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , \n",
      "but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did \n",
      "not feel afraid . There was nothing like flirtation between \n",
      "her and her partner . They seemed more like cheerful \n",
      ", easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill \n",
      "thought less of her than he had done , was \n",
      "indubitable . The ball proceeded pleasantly . The anxious cares \n",
      ", the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston , were not \n",
      "thrown away . Every body seemed happy ; and the \n",
      "praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom \n",
      "bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , \n",
      "was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence \n",
      "of this . Of very important , very recordable events \n",
      ", it was not more productive than such meetings usually \n",
      "are . There was one , however , which Emma \n",
      "thought something of. -- The two last dances before supper \n",
      "were begun , and Harriet had no partner ; -- \n",
      "the only young lady sitting down ; -- and so \n",
      "equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that \n",
      "how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder \n",
      "! -- But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , \n",
      "on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about . He would not \n",
      "ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be \n",
      "avoided : she was sure he would not -- and \n",
      "she was expecting him every moment to escape into the \n",
      "card-room . Escape , however , was not his plan \n",
      ". He came to the part of the room where \n",
      "the sitters-by were collected , spoke to some , and \n",
      "walked about in front of them , as if to \n",
      "shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it \n",
      ". He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss \n",
      "Smith , or speaking to those who were close to \n",
      "her. -- Emma saw it . She was not yet \n",
      "dancing ; she was working her way up from the \n",
      "bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , \n",
      "and by only turning her head a little she saw \n",
      "it all . When she was half-way up the set \n",
      ", the whole group were exactly behind her , and \n",
      "she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; \n",
      "but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard \n",
      "every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place \n",
      "between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that \n",
      "his wife , who was standing immediately above her , \n",
      "was not only listening also , but even encouraging him \n",
      "by significant glances. -- The kind-hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston \n",
      "had left her seat to join him and say , \n",
      "`` Do not you dance , Mr . Elton ? \n",
      "'' to which his prompt reply was , `` Most \n",
      "readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with \n",
      "me . '' `` Me ! -- oh ! no \n",
      "-- I would get you a better partner than myself \n",
      ". I am no dancer . '' `` If Mrs. \n",
      "Gilbert wishes to dance , '' said he , `` \n",
      "I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- \n",
      "for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old \n",
      "married man , and that my dancing days are over \n",
      ", it would give me very great pleasure at any \n",
      "time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs \n",
      ". Gilbert . '' `` Mrs. Gilbert does not mean \n",
      "to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged \n",
      "whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- \n",
      "Miss Smith . '' `` Miss Smith ! -- oh \n",
      "! -- I had not observed. -- You are extremely \n",
      "obliging -- and if I were not an old married \n",
      "man. -- But my dancing days are over , Mrs. \n",
      "Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else \n",
      "I should be most happy to do , at your \n",
      "command -- but my dancing days are over . '' \n",
      "Mrs. Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine \n",
      "with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to \n",
      "her seat . This was Mr. Elton ! the amiable \n",
      ", obliging , gentle Mr . Elton. -- She looked \n",
      "round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley \n",
      "at a little distance , and was arranging himself for \n",
      "settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between \n",
      "him and his wife . She would not look again \n",
      ". Her heart was in a glow , and she \n",
      "feared her face might be as hot . In another \n",
      "moment a happier sight caught her ; -- Mr. Knightley \n",
      "leading Harriet to the set ! -- Never had she \n",
      "been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at \n",
      "that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , \n",
      "both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be \n",
      "thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , \n",
      "her countenance said much , as soon as she could \n",
      "catch his eye again . His dancing proved to be \n",
      "just what she had believed it , extremely good ; \n",
      "and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if \n",
      "it had not been for the cruel state of things \n",
      "before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very \n",
      "high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced \n",
      ". It was not thrown away on her , she \n",
      "bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle \n",
      ", and was in a continual course of smiles . \n",
      "Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room , looking ( \n",
      "Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think \n",
      "he was quite so hardened as his wife , though \n",
      "growing very like her ; -- _she_ spoke some of \n",
      "her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , \n",
      "'' Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith \n",
      "! -- Very goodnatured , I declare . '' Supper \n",
      "was announced . The move began ; and Miss Bates \n",
      "might be heard from that moment , without interruption , \n",
      "till her being seated at table and taking up her \n",
      "spoon . `` Jane , Jane , my dear Jane \n",

      "and nobody missed me. -- I set off without saying \n",
      "a word , just as I told you . Grandmama \n",

      "Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon. \n",
      "-- Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples \n",
      "and wine before she came away : amazing luck in \n",
      "some of her throws : and she inquired a great \n",
      "deal about you , how you were amused , and \n",
      "who were your partners . ` Oh ! ' said \n",
      "I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I \n",
      "left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will \n",

      "of the evening ! -- Well , here we are \n",
      "at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take \n",
      "care of the two steps . Oh ! no , \n",
      "there is but one . Well , I was persuaded \n",
      "there were two . How very odd ! I was \n",
      "convinced there were two , and there is but one \n",
      ". I never saw any thing equal to the comfort \n",
      "and style -- Candles everywhere. -- I was telling you \n",
      "of your grandmama , Jane , -- There was a \n",
      "little disappointment. -- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent \n",
      "in their way , you know ; but there was \n",
      "a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in \n",
      "at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking \n",
      "the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out \n",
      "again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than \n",
      "sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , \n",
      "but we agreed we would not speak of it to \n",
      "any body , for fear of its getting round to \n",
      "dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much \n",
      "concerned ! -- Well , this is brilliant ! I \n",
      "am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing \n",
      "! -- Such elegance and profusion ! -- I have \n",

      "the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to \n",

      "Harriet . '' `` I did , '' replied Emma \n",
      ", `` and they can not forgive me . '' \n",
      "He shook his head ; but there was a smile \n",
      "of indulgence with it , and he only said , \n",
      "'' I shall not scold you . I leave you \n",
      "to your own reflections . '' `` Can you trust \n",
      "me with such flatterers ? -- Does my vain spirit \n",
      "ever tell me I am wrong ? '' `` Not \n",
      "your vain spirit , but your serious spirit. -- If \n",
      "one leads you wrong , I am sure the other \n",
      "tells you of it . '' `` I do own \n",
      "myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton . \n",
      "There is a littleness about him which you discovered , \n",
      "and which I did not : and I was fully \n",
      "convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It \n",
      "was through a series of strange blunders ! '' `` \n",
      "And , in return for your acknowledging so much , \n",
      "I will do you the justice to say , that \n",
      "you would have chosen for him better than he has \n",
      "chosen for himself. -- Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities \n",
      ", which Mrs. Elton is totally without . An unpretending \n",
      ", single-minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred \n",
      "by any man of sense and taste to such a \n",
      "woman as Mrs. Elton . I found Harriet more conversable \n",
      "than I expected . '' Emma was extremely gratified. -- \n",
      "They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling \n",
      "on every body to begin dancing again . `` Come \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what \n",
      "are you all doing ? -- Come Emma , set \n",
      "your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! \n",
      "Every body is asleep ! '' `` I am ready \n",
      ", '' said Emma , `` whenever I am wanted \n",
      ". '' `` Whom are you going to dance with \n",
      "? '' asked Mr. Knightley . She hesitated a moment \n",
      ", and then replied , `` With you , if \n",
      "you will ask me . '' `` Will you ? \n",
      "'' said he , offering his hand . `` Indeed \n",
      "I will . You have shewn that you can dance \n",
      ", and you know we are not really so much \n",
      "brother and sister as to make it at all improper \n",
      ". '' `` Brother and sister ! no , indeed \n",
      ". '' CHAPTER III This little explanation with Mr. Knightley \n",
      "gave Emma considerable pleasure . It was one of the \n",
      "agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about \n",
      "the lawn the next morning to enjoy. -- She was \n",
      "extremely glad that they had come to so good an \n",
      "understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of \n",
      "both husband and wife were so much alike ; and \n",
      "his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour \n",
      ", was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons \n",
      ", which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin \n",
      "the rest of her evening , had been the occasion \n",
      "of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked \n",
      "forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet \n",
      "'s infatuation. -- From Harriet 's manner of speaking of \n",
      "the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had \n",
      "strong hopes . It seemed as if her eyes were \n",
      "suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that \n",
      "Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed \n",
      "him . The fever was over , and Emma could \n",
      "harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by \n",
      "injurious courtesy . She depended on the evil feelings of \n",
      "the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect \n",
      "that could be farther requisite. -- Harriet rational , Frank \n",
      "Churchill not too much in love , and Mr. Knightley \n",
      "not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy \n",
      "a summer must be before her ! She was not \n",
      "to see Frank Churchill this morning . He had told \n",
      "her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of \n",
      "stopping at Hartfield , as he was to be at \n",
      "home by the middle of the day . She did \n",
      "not regret it . Having arranged all these matters , \n",
      "looked them through , and put them all to rights \n",
      ", she was just turning to the house with spirits \n",
      "freshened up for the demands of the two little boys \n",
      ", as well as of their grandpapa , when the \n",
      "great iron sweep-gate opened , and two persons entered whom \n",
      "she had never less expected to see together -- Frank \n",
      "Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually \n",
      "Harriet ! -- A moment sufficed to convince her that \n",
      "something extraordinary had happened . Harriet looked white and frightened \n",
      ", and he was trying to cheer her. -- The \n",
      "iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder \n",
      "; -- they were all three soon in the hall \n",
      ", and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away \n",
      ". A young lady who faints , must be recovered \n",
      "; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained \n",
      ". Such events are very interesting , but the suspense \n",
      "of them can not last long . A few minutes \n",
      "made Emma acquainted with the whole . Miss Smith , \n",
      "and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard \n",
      "'s , who had been also at the ball , \n",
      "had walked out together , and taken a road , \n",
      "the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough \n",
      "for safety , had led them into alarm. -- About \n",
      "half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn \n",
      ", and deeply shaded by elms on each side , \n",
      "it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and \n",
      "when the young ladies had advanced some way into it \n",
      ", they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before \n",
      "them , on a broader patch of greensward by the \n",
      "side , a party of gipsies . A child on \n",
      "the watch , came towards them to beg ; and \n",
      "Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream \n",
      ", and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran \n",
      "up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at \n",
      "the top , and made the best of her way \n",
      "by a short cut back to Highbury . But poor \n",
      "Harriet could not follow . She had suffered very much \n",
      "from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to \n",
      "mount the bank brought on such a return of it \n",
      "as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state \n",
      ", and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to \n",
      "remain . How the trampers might have behaved , had \n",
      "the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful \n",
      "; but such an invitation for attack could not be \n",
      "resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a \n",
      "dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a \n",
      "great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look \n",
      ", though not absolutely in word. -- More and more \n",
      "frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking \n",
      "out her purse , gave them a shilling , and \n",
      "begged them not to want more , or to use \n",
      "her ill. -- She was then able to walk , \n",
      "though but slowly , and was moving away -- but \n",
      "her terror and her purse were too tempting , and \n",
      "she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the \n",
      "whole gang , demanding more . In this state Frank \n",
      "Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , \n",
      "they loud and insolent . By a most fortunate chance \n",
      "his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring \n",
      "him to her assistance at this critical moment . The \n",
      "pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward \n",
      ", and leave his horses to meet him by another \n",
      "road , a mile or two beyond Highbury -- and \n",
      "happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night \n",
      "before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to \n",
      "restore them , he had been obliged to stop at \n",
      "her door , and go in for a few minutes \n",
      ": he was therefore later than he had intended ; \n",
      "and being on foot , was unseen by the whole \n",
      "party till almost close to them . The terror which \n",
      "the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was \n",
      "then their own portion . He had left them completely \n",
      "frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and \n",
      "hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to \n",
      "reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome . \n",
      "It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : \n",
      "he had thought of no other place . This was \n",
      "the amount of the whole story , -- of his \n",
      "communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had \n",
      "recovered her senses and speech. -- He dared not stay \n",
      "longer than to see her well ; these several delays \n",
      "left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma \n",
      "engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard \n",
      ", and notice of there being such a set of \n",
      "people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set \n",
      "off , with all the grateful blessings that she could \n",
      "utter for her friend and herself . Such an adventure \n",
      "as this , -- a fine young man and a \n",
      "lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , \n",
      "could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest \n",
      "heart and the steadiest brain . So Emma thought , \n",
      "at least . Could a linguist , could a grammarian \n",
      ", could even a mathematician have seen what she did \n",
      ", have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their \n",
      "history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been \n",
      "at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other \n",
      "? -- How much more must an imaginist , like \n",
      "herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight ! \n",
      "-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her \n",
      "mind had already made . It was a very extraordinary \n",
      "thing ! Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before \n",
      "to any young ladies in the place , within her \n",
      "memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind \n",
      "; -- and now it had happened to the very \n",
      "person , and at the very hour , when the \n",
      "other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue \n",
      "her ! -- It certainly was very extraordinary ! -- \n",
      "And knowing , as she did , the favourable state \n",
      "of mind of each at this period , it struck \n",
      "her the more . He was wishing to get the \n",
      "better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering \n",
      "from her mania for Mr. Elton . It seemed as \n",
      "if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences \n",
      ". It was not possible that the occurrence should not \n",
      "be strongly recommending each to the other . In the \n",
      "few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with \n",
      "him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he \n",
      "had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her \n",
      "fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , \n",
      "with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at \n",
      "last , after Harriet's own account had been given , \n",
      "he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of \n",
      "Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms . Every thing was \n",
      "to take its natural course , however , neither impelled \n",
      "nor assisted . She would not stir a step , \n",
      "nor drop a hint . No , she had had \n",
      "enough of interference . There could be no harm in \n",
      "a scheme , a mere passive scheme . It was \n",
      "no more than a wish . Beyond it she would \n",
      "on no account proceed . Emma 's first resolution was \n",
      "to keep her father from the knowledge of what had \n",
      "passed , -- aware of the anxiety and alarm it \n",
      "would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must \n",
      "be impossible . Within half an hour it was known \n",
      "all over Highbury . It was the very event to \n",
      "engage those who talk most , the young and the \n",
      "low ; and all the youth and servants in the \n",
      "place were soon in the happiness of frightful news . \n",
      "The last night 's ball seemed lost in the gipsies \n",
      ". Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and \n",
      ", as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied \n",
      "without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again \n",
      ". It was some comfort to him that many inquiries \n",
      "after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew \n",
      "that he loved to be inquired after ) , as \n",
      "well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the \n",
      "rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure \n",
      "of returning for answer , that they were all very \n",
      "indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for \n",
      "she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise \n",
      ", Emma would not interfere with . She had an \n",
      "unhappy state of health in general for the child of \n",
      "such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition \n",
      "was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for \n",
      "her , she could make no figure in a message \n",
      ". The gipsies did not wait for the operations of \n",
      "justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . \n",
      "The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in \n",
      "safety before their panic began , and the whole history \n",
      "dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to \n",
      "Emma and her nephews : -- in her imagination it \n",
      "maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still \n",
      "asking every day for the story of Harriet and the \n",
      "gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she \n",
      "varied in the slightest particular from the original recital . \n",
      "CHAPTER IV A very few days had passed after this \n",
      "adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with \n",
      "a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting \n",
      "down and hesitating , thus began : '' Miss Woodhouse \n",
      "-- if you are at leisure -- I have something \n",
      "that I should like to tell you -- a sort \n",
      "of confession to make -- and then , you know \n",
      ", it will be over . '' Emma was a \n",
      "good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak . \n",
      "There was a seriousness in Harriet 's manner which prepared \n",
      "her , quite as much as her words , for \n",
      "something more than ordinary . `` It is my duty \n",
      ", and I am sure it is my wish , \n",
      "'' she continued , '' to have no reserves with \n",
      "you on this subject . As I am happily quite \n",
      "an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very \n",
      "fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it \n",
      ". I do not want to say more than is \n",
      "necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given \n",
      "way as I have done , and I dare say \n",
      "you understand me . '' `` Yes , '' said \n",
      "Emma , `` I hope I do . '' `` \n",
      "How I could so long a time be fancying myself \n",
      "! . . . '' cried Harriet , warmly . \n",
      "`` It seems like madness ! I can see nothing \n",
      "at all extraordinary in him now. -- I do not \n",
      "care whether I meet him or not -- except that \n",
      "of the two I had rather not see him -- \n",
      "and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid \n",
      "him -- but I do not envy his wife in \n",
      "the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her \n",
      ", as I have done : she is very charming \n",
      ", I dare say , and all that , but \n",
      "I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable -- I shall \n",
      "never forget her look the other night ! -- However \n",
      ", I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish \n",
      "her no evil. -- No , let them be ever \n",
      "so happy together , it will not give me another \n",
      "moment 's pang : and to convince you that I \n",
      "have been speaking truth , I am now going to \n",
      "destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago \n",
      "-- what I ought never to have kept -- I \n",
      "know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ) \n",
      ". -- However , now I will destroy it all \n",
      "-- and it is my particular wish to do it \n",
      "in your presence , that you may see how rational \n",
      "I am grown . Can not you guess what this \n",
      "parcel holds ? '' said she , with a conscious \n",
      "look . `` Not the least in the world. -- \n",
      "Did he ever give you any thing ? '' `` \n",
      "No -- I can not call them gifts ; but \n",
      "they are things that I have valued very much . \n",
      "'' She held the parcel towards her , and Emma \n",
      "read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top . \n",
      "Her curiosity was greatly excited . Harriet unfolded the parcel \n",
      ", and she looked on with impatience . Within abundance \n",
      "of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box , \n",
      "which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the \n",
      "softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma \n",
      "saw only a small piece of court-plaister . `` Now \n",
      ", '' said Harriet , `` you _must_ recollect . \n",
      "'' `` No , indeed I do not . '' \n",
      "`` Dear me ! I should not have thought it \n",
      "possible you could forget what passed in this very room \n",
      "about court-plaister , one of the very last times we \n",
      "ever met in it ! -- It was but a \n",
      "very few days before I had my sore throat -- \n",
      "just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came -- I \n",
      "think the very evening. -- Do not you remember his \n",
      "cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your \n",
      "recommending court-plaister ? -- But , as you had none \n",
      "about you , and knew I had , you desired \n",
      "me to supply him ; and so I took mine \n",
      "out and cut him a piece ; but it was \n",
      "a great deal too large , and he cut it \n",
      "smaller , and kept playing some time with what was \n",
      "left , before he gave it back to me . \n",
      "And so then , in my nonsense , I could \n",
      "not help making a treasure of it -- so I \n",
      "put it by never to be used , and looked \n",
      "at it now and then as a great treat . \n",
      "'' `` My dearest Harriet ! '' cried Emma , \n",
      "putting her hand before her face , and jumping up \n",
      ", `` you make me more ashamed of myself than \n",
      "I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I \n",
      "remember it all now ; all , except your saving \n",
      "this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this \n",
      "moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my \n",
      "recommending court-plaister , and saying I had none about me \n",
      "! -- Oh ! my sins , my sins ! \n",
      "-- And I had plenty all the while in my \n",
      "pocket ! -- One of my senseless tricks ! -- \n",
      "I deserve to be under a continual blush all the \n",
      "rest of my life. -- Well -- ( sitting down \n",
      "again ) -- go on -- what else ? '' \n",
      "`` And had you really some at hand yourself ? \n",
      "I am sure I never suspected it , you did \n",
      "it so naturally . '' `` And so you actually \n",
      "put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake ! \n",
      "'' said Emma , recovering from her state of shame \n",
      "and feeling divided between wonder and amusement . And secretly \n",
      "she added to herself , '' Lord bless me ! \n",
      "when should I ever have thought of putting by in \n",
      "cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been \n",
      "pulling about ! I never was equal to this . \n",
      "'' `` Here , '' resumed Harriet , turning to \n",
      "her box again , `` here is something still more \n",
      "valuable , I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , \n",
      "because this is what did really once belong to him \n",
      ", which the court-plaister never did . '' Emma was \n",
      "quite eager to see this superior treasure . It was \n",
      "the end of an old pencil , -- the part \n",
      "without any lead . `` This was really his , \n",
      "'' said Harriet. -- '' Do not you remember one \n",
      "morning ? -- no , I dare say you do \n",
      "not . But one morning -- I forget exactly the \n",
      "day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday \n",
      "before _that_ _evening_ , he wanted to make a memorandum \n",
      "in his pocket-book ; it was about spruce-beer . Mr. \n",
      "Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce-beer , \n",
      "and he wanted to put it down ; but when \n",
      "he took out his pencil , there was so little \n",
      "lead that he soon cut it all away , and \n",
      "it would not do , so you lent him another \n",
      ", and this was left upon the table as good \n",
      "for nothing . But I kept my eye on it \n",
      "; and , as soon as I dared , caught \n",
      "it up , and never parted with it again from \n",
      "that moment . '' `` I do remember it , \n",
      "'' cried Emma ; `` I perfectly remember it. -- \n",
      "Talking about spruce-beer. -- Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley \n",
      "and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. \n",
      "Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too \n",
      ". I perfectly remember it. -- Stop ; Mr. Knightley \n",
      "was standing just here , was not he ? I \n",

      "`` Ah ! I do not know . I can \n",
      "not recollect. -- It is very odd , but I \n",

      "thought Emma , `` will there be a beginning of \n",
      "Mr . Churchill ? '' She had soon afterwards reason \n",
      "to believe that the beginning was already made , and \n",
      "could not but hope that the gipsy , though she \n",
      "had _told_ no fortune , might be proved to have \n",
      "made Harriet's. -- About a fortnight after the alarm , \n",
      "they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly \n",
      ". Emma was not thinking of it at the moment \n",
      ", which made the information she received more valuable . \n",
      "She merely said , in the course of some trivial \n",
      "chat , `` Well , Harriet , whenever you marry \n",
      "I would advise you to do so and so '' \n",
      "-- and thought no more of it , till after \n",
      "a minute 's silence she heard Harriet say in a \n",
      "very serious tone , `` I shall never marry . \n",
      "'' Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how \n",
      "it was ; and after a moment 's debate , \n",
      "as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , \n",
      "replied , '' Never marry ! -- This is a \n",
      "new resolution . '' `` It is one that I \n",
      "shall never change , however . '' After another short \n",
      "hesitation , `` I hope it does not proceed from \n",

      "and Emma could just catch the words , `` so \n",
      "superior to Mr . Elton ! '' She then took \n",
      "a longer time for consideration . Should she proceed no \n",
      "farther ? -- should she let it pass , and \n",
      "seem to suspect nothing ? -- Perhaps Harriet might think \n",
      "her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps \n",
      "if she were totally silent , it might only drive \n",
      "Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and \n",
      "against any thing like such an unreserve as had been \n",
      ", such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and \n",
      "chances , she was perfectly resolved. -- She believed it \n",

      "once , all that she meant to say and know \n",
      ". Plain dealing was always best . She had previously \n",
      "determined how far she would proceed , on any application \n",

      "and thus spoke -- '' Harriet , I will not \n",

      "in silent and submissive gratitude . Emma was very decided \n",

      "friend . Its tendency would be to raise and refine \n",
      "her mind -- and it must be saving her from \n",
      "the danger of degradation . CHAPTER V In this state \n",
      "of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , June \n",
      "opened upon Hartfield . To Highbury in general it brought \n",
      "no material change . The Eltons were still talking of \n",
      "a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use \n",
      "to be made of their barouche-landau ; and Jane Fairfax \n",
      "was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the \n",
      "return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , \n",
      "and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it \n",
      ", she was likely to remain there full two months \n",
      "longer , provided at least she were able to defeat \n",
      "Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save \n",
      "herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her \n",
      "will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason \n",
      "best known to himself , had certainly taken an early \n",
      "dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike \n",
      "him more . He began to suspect him of some \n",
      "double dealing in his pursuit of Emma . That Emma \n",
      "was his object appeared indisputable . Every thing declared it \n",
      "; his own attentions , his father 's hints , \n",
      "his mother-in-law 's guarded silence ; it was all in \n",
      "unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion \n",
      ", told the same story . But while so many \n",
      "were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making \n",
      "him over to Harriet , Mr. Knightley began to suspect \n",
      "him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax . \n",
      "He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms \n",
      "of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least \n",
      "-- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , \n",
      "having once observed , he could not persuade himself to \n",
      "think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish \n",
      "to escape any of Emma 's errors of imagination . \n",
      "_She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose . \n",
      "He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane \n",
      ", at the Eltons ' ; and he had seen \n",
      "a look , more than a single look , at \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place . When he \n",
      "was again in their company , he could not help \n",
      "remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid \n",
      "observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his \n",
      "fire at twilight , '' Myself creating what I saw \n",
      ", '' brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being \n",
      "a something of private liking , of private understanding even \n",
      ", between Frank Churchill and Jane . He had walked \n",
      "up one day after dinner , as he very often \n",
      "did , to spend his evening at Hartfield . Emma \n",
      "and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them \n",
      "; and , on returning , they fell in with \n",
      "a larger party , who , like themselves , judged \n",
      "it wisest to take their exercise early , as the \n",
      "weather threatened rain ; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their \n",
      "son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had \n",
      "accidentally met . They all united ; and , on \n",
      "reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was \n",
      "exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to \n",
      "her father , pressed them all to go in and \n",
      "drink tea with him . The Randalls party agreed to \n",
      "it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from \n",
      "Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she \n",
      "also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse 's \n",
      "most obliging invitation . As they were turning into the \n",
      "grounds , Mr. Perry passed by on horseback . The \n",
      "gentlemen spoke of his horse . `` By the bye \n",
      ", '' said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently , \n",
      "'' what became of Mr. Perry 's plan of setting \n",
      "up his carriage ? '' Mrs. Weston looked surprized , \n",
      "and said , `` I did not know that he \n",
      "ever had any such plan . '' `` Nay , \n",
      "I had it from you . You wrote me word \n",
      "of it three months ago . '' `` Me ! \n",
      "impossible ! '' `` Indeed you did . I remember \n",
      "it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly \n",
      "to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody \n",
      ", and was extremely happy about it . It was \n",
      "owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being \n",
      "out in bad weather did him a great deal of \n",
      "harm . You must remember it now ? '' `` \n",
      "Upon my word I never heard of it till this \n",
      "moment . '' `` Never ! really , never ! \n",
      "-- Bless me ! how could it be ? -- \n",
      "Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was \n",
      "completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if \n",
      "you were tired . You will not be sorry to \n",
      "find yourself at home . '' `` What is this \n",
      "? -- What is this ? '' cried Mr. Weston \n",
      ", `` about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry \n",
      "going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I \n",
      "am glad he can afford it . You had it \n",
      "from himself , had you ? '' `` No , \n",
      "sir , '' replied his son , laughing , `` \n",
      "I seem to have had it from nobody. -- Very \n",
      "odd ! -- I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's \n",
      "having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe \n",
      ", many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- \n",
      "but as she declares she never heard a syllable of \n",
      "it before , of course it must have been a \n",
      "dream . I am a great dreamer . I dream \n",
      "of every body at Highbury when I am away -- \n",
      "and when I have gone through my particular friends , \n",
      "then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs . Perry \n",
      ". '' `` It is odd though , '' observed \n",
      "his father , `` that you should have had such \n",
      "a regular connected dream about people whom it was not \n",
      "very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe . \n",
      "Perry 's setting up his carriage ! and his wife \n",
      "'s persuading him to it , out of care for \n",
      "his health -- just what will happen , I have \n",
      "no doubt , some time or other ; only a \n",
      "little premature . What an air of probability sometimes runs \n",
      "through a dream ! And at others , what a \n",
      "heap of absurdities it is ! Well , Frank , \n",
      "your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts \n",
      "when you are absent . Emma , you are a \n",
      "great dreamer , I think ? '' Emma was out \n",
      "of hearing . She had hurried on before her guests \n",
      "to prepare her father for their appearance , and was \n",
      "beyond the reach of Mr. Weston 's hint . `` \n",
      "Why , to own the truth , '' cried Miss \n",
      "Bates , who had been trying in vain to be \n",
      "heard the last two minutes , `` if I must \n",
      "speak on this subject , there is no denying that \n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean \n",
      "to say that he did not dream it -- I \n",
      "am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the \n",
      "world -- but if I am questioned about it , \n",
      "I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last \n",
      "spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my \n",
      "mother , and the Coles knew of it as well \n",
      "as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , \n",
      "known to nobody else , and only thought of about \n",
      "three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he \n",
      "should have a carriage , and came to my mother \n",
      "in great spirits one morning because she thought she had \n",
      "prevailed . Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's \n",
      "telling us of it when we got home ? I \n",
      "forget where we had been walking to -- very likely \n",
      "to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to \n",
      "Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my \n",
      "mother -- indeed I do not know who is not \n",
      "-- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence \n",
      "; she had no objection to her telling us , \n",
      "of course , but it was not to go beyond \n",
      ": and , from that day to this , I \n",
      "never mentioned it to a soul that I know of \n",
      ". At the same time , I will not positively \n",
      "answer for my having never dropt a hint , because \n",
      "I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before \n",
      "I am aware . I am a talker , you \n",
      "know ; I am rather a talker ; and now \n",
      "and then I have let a thing escape me which \n",
      "I should not . I am not like Jane ; \n",
      "I wish I were . I will answer for it \n",
      "_she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world . \n",
      "Where is she ? -- Oh ! just behind . \n",
      "Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry 's coming. -- Extraordinary dream , \n",
      "indeed ! '' They were entering the hall . Mr. \n",
      "Knightley 's eyes had preceded Miss Bates 's in a \n",
      "glance at Jane . From Frank Churchill 's face , \n",
      "where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away \n",
      ", he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she \n",
      "was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl \n",
      ". Mr. Weston had walked in . The two other \n",
      "gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . \n",
      "Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching \n",
      "her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in \n",
      "vain , however , if it were so -- Jane \n",
      "passed between them into the hall , and looked at \n",
      "neither . There was no time for farther remark or \n",
      "explanation . The dream must be borne with , and \n",
      "Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round \n",
      "the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at \n",
      "Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had \n",
      "power to place there and persuade her father to use \n",
      ", instead of the small-sized Pembroke , on which two \n",
      "of his daily meals had , for forty years been \n",
      "crowded . Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in \n",
      "a hurry to move . `` Miss Woodhouse , '' \n",
      "said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him \n",
      ", which he could reach as he sat , `` \n",
      "have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box \n",
      "of letters ? It used to stand here . Where \n",
      "is it ? This is a sort of dull-looking evening \n",
      ", that ought to be treated rather as winter than \n",
      "summer . We had great amusement with those letters one \n",
      "morning . I want to puzzle you again . '' \n",
      "Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the \n",
      "box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets \n",
      ", which no one seemed so much disposed to employ \n",
      "as their two selves . They were rapidly forming words \n",
      "for each other , or for any body else who \n",
      "would be puzzled . The quietness of the game made \n",
      "it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse , who had often \n",
      "been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr. \n",
      "Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily \n",
      "occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the \n",
      "departure of the `` poor little boys , '' or \n",
      "in fondly pointing out , as he took up any \n",
      "stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written \n",
      "it . Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax \n",
      ". She gave a slight glance round the table , \n",
      "and applied herself to it . Frank was next to \n",
      "Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr. Knightley \n",
      "so placed as to see them all ; and it \n",
      "was his object to see as much as he could \n",
      ", with as little apparent observation . The word was \n",
      "discovered , and with a faint smile pushed away . \n",
      "If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , \n",
      "and buried from sight , she should have looked on \n",
      "the table instead of looking just across , for it \n",
      "was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every \n",
      "fresh word , and finding out none , directly took \n",
      "it up , and fell to work . She was \n",
      "sitting by Mr. Knightley , and turned to him for \n",
      "help . The word was _blunder_ ; and as Harriet \n",
      "exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane \n",
      "'s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible \n",
      ". Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream ; but \n",
      "how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension \n",
      ". How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite \n",
      "could have been so lain asleep ! He feared there \n",
      "must be some decided involvement . Disingenuousness and double dealing \n",
      "seemed to meet him at every turn . These letters \n",
      "were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick . It \n",
      "was a child 's play , chosen to conceal a \n",
      "deeper game on Frank Churchill 's part . With great \n",
      "indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great \n",
      "alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded \n",
      "companions . He saw a short word prepared for Emma \n",
      ", and given to her with a look sly and \n",
      "demure . He saw that Emma had soon made it \n",
      "out , and found it highly entertaining , though it \n",
      "was something which she judged it proper to appear to \n",
      "censure ; for she said , `` Nonsense ! for \n",
      "shame ! '' He heard Frank Churchill next say , \n",
      "with a glance towards Jane , '' I will give \n",
      "it to her -- shall I ? '' -- and \n",
      "as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth \n",
      ". `` No , no , you must not ; \n",
      "you shall not , indeed . '' It was done \n",
      "however . This gallant young man , who seemed to \n",
      "love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance \n",
      ", directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , \n",
      "and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her \n",
      "to study it . Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity to know \n",
      "what this word might be , made him seize every \n",
      "possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and \n",
      "it was not long before he saw it to be \n",
      "_Dixon_ . Jane Fairfax 's perception seemed to accompany his \n",
      "; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert \n",
      "meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters \n",
      "so arranged . She was evidently displeased ; looked up \n",
      ", and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than \n",
      "he had ever perceived her , and saying only , \n",
      "`` I did not know that proper names were allowed \n",
      ", '' pushed away the letters with even an angry \n",
      "spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no \n",
      "other word that could be offered . Her face was \n",
      "averted from those who had made the attack , and \n",
      "turned towards her aunt . `` Aye , very true \n",
      ", my dear , '' cried the latter , though \n",
      "Jane had not spoken a word -- '' I was \n",

      "is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for \n",
      "us . My dear sir , you are too obliging \n",
      ". We really must wish you good night . '' \n",
      "Jane 's alertness in moving , proved her as ready \n",
      "as her aunt had preconceived . She was immediately up \n",
      ", and wanting to quit the table ; but so \n",
      "many were also moving , that she could not get \n",
      "away ; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection \n",
      "of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept \n",
      "away by her unexamined . She was afterwards looking for \n",
      "her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it \n",
      "was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion \n",
      "; and how they parted , Mr. Knightley could not \n",
      "tell . He remained at Hartfield after all the rest \n",
      ", his thoughts full of what he had seen ; \n",
      "so full , that when the candles came to assist \n",
      "his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly \n",
      "must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- \n",
      "give Emma some hint , ask her some question . \n",
      "He could not see her in a situation of such \n",

      "his duty . `` Pray , Emma , '' said \n",
      "he , `` may I ask in what lay the \n",
      "great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word \n",
      "given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the \n",
      "word , and am curious to know how it could \n",
      "be so very entertaining to the one , and so \n",
      "very distressing to the other . '' Emma was extremely \n",
      "confused . She could not endure to give him the \n",
      "true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no \n",
      "means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever \n",
      "imparted them . `` Oh ! '' she cried in \n",
      "evident embarrassment , `` it all meant nothing ; a \n",
      "mere joke among ourselves . '' `` The joke , \n",
      "'' he replied gravely , `` seemed confined to you \n",
      "and Mr . Churchill . '' He had hoped she \n",
      "would speak again , but she did not . She \n",
      "would rather busy herself about any thing than speak . \n",
      "He sat a little while in doubt . A variety \n",
      "of evils crossed his mind . Interference -- fruitless interference \n",
      ". Emma 's confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , \n",
      "seemed to declare her affection engaged . Yet he would \n",
      "speak . He owed it to her , to risk \n",
      "any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference \n",
      ", rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing \n",
      ", rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a \n",
      "cause . `` My dear Emma , '' said he \n",
      "at last , with earnest kindness , `` do you \n",

      "gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? '' \n",
      "`` Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh \n",
      "! yes , perfectly. -- Why do you make a \n",
      "doubt of it ? '' `` Have you never at \n",
      "any time had reason to think that he admired her \n",
      ", or that she admired him ? '' `` Never \n",
      ", never ! '' she cried with a most open \n",
      "eagerness -- '' Never , for the twentieth part of \n",
      "a moment , did such an idea occur to me \n",
      ". And how could it possibly come into your head \n",
      "? '' `` I have lately imagined that I saw \n",
      "symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , \n",
      "which I did not believe meant to be public . \n",
      "'' `` Oh ! you amuse me excessively . I \n",
      "am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let \n",
      "your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- \n",
      "very sorry to check you in your first essay -- \n",
      "but indeed it will not do . There is no \n",
      "admiration between them , I do assure you ; and \n",
      "the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from \n",
      "some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different \n",
      "nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain : -- \n",
      "there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- \n",
      "but the part which is capable of being communicated , \n",
      "which is sense , is , that they are as \n",
      "far from any attachment or admiration for one another , \n",
      "as any two beings in the world can be . \n",
      "That is , I _presume_ it to be so on \n",
      "her side , and I can _answer_ for its being \n",
      "so on his . I will answer for the gentleman \n",
      "'s indifference . '' She spoke with a confidence which \n",
      "staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr. Knightley \n",
      ". She was in gay spirits , and would have \n",
      "prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of \n",
      "his suspicions , every look described , and all the \n",
      "wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her \n",
      ": but his gaiety did not meet hers . He \n",
      "found he could not be useful , and his feelings \n",
      "were too much irritated for talking . That he might \n",
      "not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the \n",
      "fire which Mr. Woodhouse 's tender habits required almost every \n",
      "evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a \n",
      "hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and \n",
      "solitude of Donwell Abbey . CHAPTER VI After being long \n",
      "fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and \n",
      "Mrs. Suckling , the Highbury world were obliged to endure \n",
      "the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come \n",
      "till the autumn . No such importation of novelties could \n",
      "enrich their intellectual stores at present . In the daily \n",
      "interchange of news , they must be again restricted to \n",
      "the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' \n",
      "coming had been united , such as the last accounts \n",
      "of Mrs. Churchill , whose health seemed every day to \n",
      "supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs. \n",
      "Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might \n",
      "eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a \n",
      "child , as that of all her neighbours was by \n",
      "the approach of it . Mrs. Elton was very much \n",
      "disappointed . It was the delay of a great deal \n",
      "of pleasure and parade . Her introductions and recommendations must \n",
      "all wait , and every projected party be still only \n",
      "talked of . So she thought at first ; -- \n",
      "but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need \n",
      "not be put off . Why should not they explore \n",
      "to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come ? \n",
      "They could go there again with them in the autumn \n",
      ". It was settled that they should go to Box \n",
      "Hill . That there was to be such a party \n",
      "had been long generally known : it had even given \n",
      "the idea of another . Emma had never been to \n",
      "Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body \n",
      "found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr. \n",
      "Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive \n",
      "thither . Two or three more of the chosen only \n",
      "were to be admitted to join them , and it \n",
      "was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , \n",
      "elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation \n",
      ", the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade \n",
      "of the Eltons and the Sucklings . This was so \n",
      "very well understood between them , that Emma could not \n",
      "but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , \n",
      "on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing \n",
      "to Mrs. Elton , as her brother and sister had \n",
      "failed her , that the two parties should unite , \n",
      "and go together ; and that as Mrs. Elton had \n",
      "very readily acceded to it , so it was to \n",
      "be , if she had no objection . Now , \n",
      "as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike \n",
      "of Mrs. Elton , of which Mr. Weston must already \n",
      "be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward \n",
      "again : -- it could not be done without a \n",
      "reproof to him , which would be giving pain to \n",
      "his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to \n",
      "consent to an arrangement which she would have done a \n",
      "great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably \n",
      "expose her even to the degradation of being said to \n",
      "be of Mrs. Elton 's party ! Every feeling was \n",
      "offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left \n",
      "a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections \n",
      "on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston 's temper . \n",
      "`` I am glad you approve of what I have \n",
      "done , '' said he very comfortably . `` But \n",
      "I thought you would . Such schemes as these are \n",
      "nothing without numbers . One can not have too large \n",
      "a party . A large party secures its own amusement \n",
      ". And she is a good-natured woman after all . \n",
      "One could not leave her out . '' Emma denied \n",
      "none of it aloud , and agreed to none of \n",
      "it in private . It was now the middle of \n",
      "June , and the weather fine ; and Mrs. Elton \n",
      "was growing impatient to name the day , and settle \n",
      "with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb , \n",
      "when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty \n",
      ". It might be weeks , it might be only \n",
      "a few days , before the horse were useable ; \n",
      "but no preparations could be ventured on , and it \n",
      "was all melancholy stagnation . Mrs. Elton 's resources were \n",
      "inadequate to such an attack . `` Is not this \n",
      "most vexations , Knightley ? '' she cried. -- '' \n",
      "And such weather for exploring ! -- These delays and \n",
      "disappointments are quite odious . What are we to do \n",
      "? -- The year will wear away at this rate \n",
      ", and nothing done . Before this time last year \n",
      "I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party \n",
      "from Maple Grove to Kings Weston . '' `` You \n",
      "had better explore to Donwell , '' replied Mr. Knightley \n",
      ". `` That may be done without horses . Come \n",
      ", and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast \n",
      ". '' If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously , \n",
      "he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal \n",
      "was caught at with delight ; and the `` Oh \n",
      "! I should like it of all things , '' \n",
      "was not plainer in words than manner . Donwell was \n",
      "famous for its strawberry-beds , which seemed a plea for \n",
      "the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage-beds \n",
      "would have been enough to tempt the lady , who \n",
      "only wanted to be going somewhere . She promised him \n",
      "again and again to come -- much oftener than he \n",
      "doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof \n",
      "of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose \n",
      "to consider it . `` You may depend upon me \n",
      ", '' said she . `` I certainly will come \n",
      ". Name your day , and I will come . \n",
      "You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? '' \n",
      "`` I can not name a day , '' said \n",
      "he , `` till I have spoken to some others \n",
      "whom I would wish to meet you . '' `` \n",
      "Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give \n",
      "me a carte-blanche. -- I am Lady Patroness , you \n",
      "know . It is my party . I will bring \n",
      "friends with me . '' `` I hope you will \n",
      "bring Elton , '' said he : `` but I \n",
      "will not trouble you to give any other invitations . \n",
      "'' `` Oh ! now you are looking very sly \n",
      ". But consider -- you need not be afraid of \n",
      "delegating power to _me_ . I am no young lady \n",
      "on her preferment . Married women , you know , \n",
      "may be safely authorised . It is my party . \n",
      "Leave it all to me . I will invite your \n",
      "guests . '' `` No , '' -- he calmly \n",
      "replied , -- '' there is but one married woman \n",
      "in the world whom I can ever allow to invite \n",
      "what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one \n",
      "is -- '' '' -- Mrs. Weston , I suppose \n",
      ", '' interrupted Mrs. Elton , rather mortified . `` \n",
      "No -- Mrs. Knightley ; -- and till she is \n",
      "in being , I will manage such matters myself . \n",
      "'' `` Ah ! you are an odd creature ! \n",
      "'' she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred \n",
      "to herself. -- '' You are a humourist , and \n",
      "may say what you like . Quite a humourist . \n",
      "Well , I shall bring Jane with me -- Jane \n",
      "and her aunt. -- The rest I leave to you \n",
      ". I have no objections at all to meeting the \n",
      "Hartfield family . Do n't scruple . I know you \n",
      "are attached to them . '' `` You certainly will \n",
      "meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall \n",
      "call on Miss Bates in my way home . '' \n",
      "`` That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every \n",
      "day : -- but as you like . It is \n",
      "to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley \n",
      "; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a \n",
      "large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets \n",
      "hanging on my arm . Here , -- probably this \n",
      "basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple \n",
      ", you see . And Jane will have such another \n",
      ". There is to be no form or parade -- \n",
      "a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk \n",
      "about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , \n",
      "and sit under trees ; -- and whatever else you \n",
      "may like to provide , it is to be all \n",
      "out of doors -- a table spread in the shade \n",
      ", you know . Every thing as natural and simple \n",
      "as possible . Is not that your idea ? '' \n",
      "`` Not quite . My idea of the simple and \n",
      "the natural will be to have the table spread in \n",
      "the dining-room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen \n",
      "and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I \n",
      "think is best observed by meals within doors . When \n",
      "you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , \n",
      "there shall be cold meat in the house . '' \n",
      "`` Well -- as you please ; only do n't \n",
      "have a great set out . And , by the \n",
      "bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any \n",
      "use to you with our opinion ? -- Pray be \n",
      "sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk \n",
      "to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything -- '' \n",
      "'' I have not the least wish for it , \n",
      "I thank you . '' `` Well -- but if \n",
      "any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever \n",
      ". '' `` I will answer for it , that \n",
      "mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn \n",
      "any body 's assistance . '' `` I wish we \n",
      "had a donkey . The thing would be for us \n",
      "all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates \n",
      ", and me -- and my caro sposo walking by \n",
      ". I really must talk to him about purchasing a \n",
      "donkey . In a country life I conceive it to \n",
      "be a sort of necessary ; for , let a \n",
      "woman have ever so many resources , it is not \n",
      "possible for her to be always shut up at home \n",
      "; -- and very long walks , you know -- \n",
      "in summer there is dust , and in winter there \n",
      "is dirt . '' `` You will not find either \n",
      ", between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never \n",
      "dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come \n",
      "on a donkey , however , if you prefer it \n",
      ". You can borrow Mrs. Cole 's . I would \n",
      "wish every thing to be as much to your taste \n",
      "as possible . '' `` That I am sure you \n",
      "would . Indeed I do you justice , my good \n",

      "manner , I know you have the warmest heart . \n",
      "As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough \n",
      "humourist. -- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I \n",
      "am fully sensible of your attention to me in the \n",
      "whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the \n",
      "very thing to please me . '' Mr. Knightley had \n",
      "another reason for avoiding a table in the shade . \n",
      "He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse , as well as \n",
      "Emma , to join the party ; and he knew \n",
      "that to have any of them sitting down out of \n",
      "doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "must not , under the specious pretence of a morning \n",
      "drive , and an hour or two spent at Donwell \n",
      ", be tempted away to his misery . He was \n",
      "invited on good faith . No lurking horrors were to \n",
      "upbraid him for his easy credulity . He did consent \n",
      ". He had not been at Donwell for two years \n",
      ". `` Some very fine morning , he , and \n",
      "Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; \n",
      "and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while \n",
      "the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did \n",
      "not suppose they could be damp now , in the \n",
      "middle of the day . He should like to see \n",
      "the old house again exceedingly , and should be very \n",
      "happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any \n",
      "other of his neighbours. -- He could not see any \n",
      "objection at all to his , and Emma 's , \n",
      "and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning . \n",
      "He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to \n",
      "invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer \n",
      "than dining out. -- He was not fond of dining \n",
      "out . '' Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body \n",
      "'s most ready concurrence . The invitation was everywhere so \n",
      "well received , that it seemed as if , like \n",
      "Mrs. Elton , they were all taking the scheme as \n",
      "a particular compliment to themselves. -- Emma and Harriet professed \n",
      "very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr. \n",
      "Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to \n",
      "join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation \n",
      "and gratitude which could have been dispensed with. -- Mr. \n",
      "Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be \n",
      "glad to see him ; and Mr. Weston engaged to \n",
      "lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments \n",
      "to induce him to come . In the meanwhile the \n",
      "lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to \n",
      "Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at \n",
      "last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box \n",
      "Hill for the next , -- the weather appearing exactly \n",
      "right . Under a bright mid-day sun , at almost \n",
      "Midsummer , Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage \n",
      ", with one window down , to partake of this \n",
      "al-fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable \n",
      "rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by \n",
      "a fire all the morning , he was happily placed \n",
      ", quite at his ease , ready to talk with \n",
      "pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every \n",
      "body to come and sit down , and not to \n",
      "heat themselves. -- Mrs. Weston , who seemed to have \n",
      "walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit \n",
      "all the time with him , remained , when all \n",
      "the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient \n",
      "listener and sympathiser . It was so long since Emma \n",
      "had been at the Abbey , that as soon as \n",
      "she was satisfied of her father 's comfort , she \n",
      "was glad to leave him , and look around her \n",
      "; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more \n",
      "particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and \n",
      "grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and \n",
      "all her family . She felt all the honest pride \n",
      "and complacency which her alliance with the present and future \n",
      "proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable \n",
      "size and style of the building , its suitable , \n",
      "becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its \n",
      "ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream \n",
      ", of which the Abbey , with all the old \n",
      "neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and \n",
      "its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which \n",
      "neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up. -- The house \n",
      "was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , \n",
      "covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular \n",
      ", with many comfortable , and one or two handsome \n",
      "rooms. -- It was just what it ought to be \n",
      ", and it looked what it was -- and Emma \n",
      "felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence \n",
      "of a family of such true gentility , untainted in \n",
      "blood and understanding. -- Some faults of temper John Knightley \n",
      "had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably . She \n",
      "had given them neither men , nor names , nor \n",
      "places , that could raise a blush . These were \n",
      "pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them \n",
      "till it was necessary to do as the others did \n",
      ", and collect round the strawberry-beds. -- The whole party \n",
      "were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected \n",
      "every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs. Elton , in \n",
      "all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and \n",
      "her basket , was very ready to lead the way \n",
      "in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , \n",

      "-- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came \n",
      "out , in her solicitude after her son-in-law , to \n",
      "inquire if he were come -- and she was a \n",
      "little uneasy. -- She had some fears of his horse \n",
      ". Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and \n",
      "now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and \n",
      "Jane Fairfax were talking of. -- A situation , a \n",
      "most desirable situation , was in question . Mrs. Elton \n",
      "had received notice of it that morning , and was \n",
      "in raptures . It was not with Mrs. Suckling , \n",
      "it was not with Mrs. Bragge , but in felicity \n",
      "and splendour it fell short only of them : it \n",
      "was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge , an acquaintance \n",
      "of Mrs. Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove \n",
      ". Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , \n",
      "spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and \n",
      "Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with \n",
      "immediately. -- On her side , all was warmth , \n",
      "energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to \n",
      "take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued \n",
      "to assure her that she would not at present engage \n",
      "in any thing , repeating the same motives which she \n",
      "had been heard to urge before. -- Still Mrs. Elton \n",
      "insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the \n",
      "morrow 's post. -- How Jane could bear it at \n",
      "all , was astonishing to Emma. -- She did look \n",
      "vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last \n",
      ", with a decision of action unusual to her , \n",
      "proposed a removal. -- '' Should not they walk ? \n",
      "Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens -- all \n",
      "the gardens ? -- She wished to see the whole \n",
      "extent . '' -- The pertinacity of her friend seemed \n",
      "more than she could bear . It was hot ; \n",
      "and after walking some time over the gardens in a \n",
      "scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , \n",
      "they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of \n",
      "a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond \n",
      "the garden at an equal distance from the river , \n",
      "seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds. -- It led \n",
      "to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end \n",
      "over a low stone wall with high pillars , which \n",
      "seemed intended , in their erection , to give the \n",
      "appearance of an approach to the house , which never \n",
      "had been there . Disputable , however , as might \n",
      "be the taste of such a termination , it was \n",
      "in itself a charming walk , and the view which \n",
      "closed it extremely pretty. -- The considerable slope , at \n",
      "nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood , gradually \n",
      "acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at \n",
      "half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness \n",
      "and grandeur , well clothed with wood ; -- and \n",
      "at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and \n",
      "sheltered , rose the Abbey Mill Farm , with meadows \n",
      "in front , and the river making a close and \n",
      "handsome curve around it . It was a sweet view \n",
      "-- sweet to the eye and the mind . English \n",
      "verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under \n",
      "a sun bright , without being oppressive . In this \n",
      "walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled \n",
      "; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley \n",
      "and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the \n",
      "way . Mr. Knightley and Harriet ! -- It was \n",
      "an odd tete-a-tete ; but she was glad to see \n",
      "it. -- There had been a time when he would \n",
      "have scorned her as a companion , and turned from \n",
      "her with little ceremony . Now they seemed in pleasant \n",
      "conversation . There had been a time also when Emma \n",
      "would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot \n",
      "so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now \n",
      "she feared it not . It might be safely viewed \n",
      "with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its \n",
      "rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , \n",
      "and light column of smoke ascending. -- She joined them \n",
      "at the wall , and found them more engaged in \n",
      "talking than in looking around . He was giving Harriet \n",
      "information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and \n",
      "Emma received a smile which seemed to say , `` \n",
      "These are my own concerns . I have a right \n",
      "to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of \n",
      "introducing Robert Martin . '' -- She did not suspect \n",
      "him . It was too old a story. -- Robert \n",
      "Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet. -- They \n",
      "took a few turns together along the walk. -- The \n",
      "shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the \n",
      "pleasantest part of the day . The next remove was \n",
      "to the house ; they must all go in and \n",
      "eat ; -- and they were all seated and busy \n",
      ", and still Frank Churchill did not come . Mrs. \n",
      "Weston looked , and looked in vain . His father \n",
      "would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her \n",
      "fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing \n",
      "that he would part with his black mare . He \n",
      "had expressed himself as to coming , with more than \n",
      "common certainty . `` His aunt was so much better \n",
      ", that he had not a doubt of getting over \n",
      "to them. '' -- Mrs . Churchill 's state , \n",
      "however , as many were ready to remind her , \n",
      "was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her \n",
      "nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs. Weston \n",
      "was at last persuaded to believe , or to say \n",
      ", that it must be by some attack of Mrs. \n",
      "Churchill that he was prevented coming. -- Emma looked at \n",
      "Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved \n",
      "very well , and betrayed no emotion . The cold \n",
      "repast was over , and the party were to go \n",
      "out once more to see what had not yet been \n",
      "seen , the old Abbey fish-ponds ; perhaps get as \n",
      "far as the clover , which was to be begun \n",
      "cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate \n",
      ", have the pleasure of being hot , and growing \n",
      "cool again. -- Mr . Woodhouse , who had already \n",
      "taken his little round in the highest part of the \n",
      "gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined \n",
      "even by him , stirred no more ; and his \n",
      "daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs. Weston \n",
      "might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise \n",
      "and variety which her spirits seemed to need . Mr. \n",
      "Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's \n",
      "entertainment . Books of engravings , drawers of medals , \n",
      "cameos , corals , shells , and every other family \n",
      "collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his \n",
      "old friend , to while away the morning ; and \n",
      "the kindness had perfectly answered . Mr. Woodhouse had been \n",
      "exceedingly well amused . Mrs. Weston had been shewing them \n",
      "all to him , and now he would shew them \n",
      "all to Emma ; -- fortunate in having no other \n",
      "resemblance to a child , than in a total want \n",
      "of taste for what he saw , for he was \n",
      "slow , constant , and methodical. -- Before this second \n",
      "looking over was begun , however , Emma walked into \n",
      "the hall for the sake of a few moments ' \n",
      "free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house \n",
      "-- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared \n",
      ", coming quickly in from the garden , and with \n",
      "a look of escape. -- Little expecting to meet Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first \n",
      "; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was \n",
      "in quest of . `` Will you be so kind \n",
      ", '' said she , `` when I am missed \n",
      ", as to say that I am gone home ? \n",
      "-- I am going this moment. -- My aunt is \n",
      "not aware how late it is , nor how long \n",
      "we have been absent -- but I am sure we \n",
      "shall be wanted , and I am determined to go \n",
      "directly. -- I have said nothing about it to any \n",
      "body . It would only be giving trouble and distress \n",
      ". Some are gone to the ponds , and some \n",
      "to the lime walk . Till they all come in \n",
      "I shall not be missed ; and when they do \n",
      ", will you have the goodness to say that I \n",
      "am gone ? '' `` Certainly , if you wish \n",
      "it ; -- but you are not going to walk \n",
      "to Highbury alone ? '' `` Yes -- what should \n",
      "hurt me ? -- I walk fast . I shall \n",
      "be at home in twenty minutes . '' `` But \n",
      "it is too far , indeed it is , to \n",
      "be walking quite alone . Let my father 's servant \n",
      "go with you. -- Let me order the carriage . \n",
      "It can be round in five minutes . '' `` \n",
      "Thank you , thank you -- but on no account. \n",
      "-- I would rather walk. -- And for _me_ to \n",
      "be afraid of walking alone ! -- I , who \n",
      "may so soon have to guard others ! '' She \n",
      "spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied \n",
      ", '' That can be no reason for your being \n",
      "exposed to danger now . I must order the carriage \n",
      ". The heat even would be danger. -- You are \n",
      "fatigued already . '' `` I am , '' -- \n",
      "she answered -- '' I am fatigued ; but it \n",
      "is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will \n",
      "refresh me. -- Miss Woodhouse , we all know at \n",
      "times what it is to be wearied in spirits . \n",
      "Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest \n",
      "kindness you can shew me , will be to let \n",
      "me have my own way , and only say that \n",
      "I am gone when it is necessary . '' Emma \n",
      "had not another word to oppose . She saw it \n",
      "all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her \n",
      "quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off \n",
      "with the zeal of a friend . Her parting look \n",
      "was grateful -- and her parting words , `` Oh \n",
      "! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone \n",
      "! '' -- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart \n",
      ", and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to \n",
      "be practised by her , even towards some of those \n",
      "who loved her best . `` Such a home , \n",
      "indeed ! such an aunt ! '' said Emma , \n",
      "as she turned back into the hall again . `` \n",
      "I do pity you . And the more sensibility you \n",
      "betray of their just horrors , the more I shall \n",
      "like you . '' Jane had not been gone a \n",
      "quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished \n",
      "some views of St. Mark 's Place , Venice , \n",
      "when Frank Churchill entered the room . Emma had not \n",
      "been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think \n",
      "of him -- but she was very glad to see \n",
      "him . Mrs. Weston would be at ease . The \n",
      "black mare was blameless ; _they_ were right who had \n",
      "named Mrs. Churchill as the cause . He had been \n",
      "detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; \n",
      "a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- \n",
      "and he had quite given up every thought of coming \n",
      ", till very late ; -- and had he known \n",
      "how hot a ride he should have , and how \n",
      "late , with all his hurry , he must be \n",
      ", he believed he should not have come at all \n",
      ". The heat was excessive ; he had never suffered \n",
      "any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid \n",
      "at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he \n",
      "could bear any degree of cold , etc. , but \n",
      "heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at \n",
      "the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. \n",
      "Woodhouse 's fire , looking very deplorable . `` You \n",
      "will soon be cooler , if you sit still , \n",
      "'' said Emma . `` As soon as I am \n",
      "cooler I shall go back again . I could very \n",
      "ill be spared -- but such a point had been \n",
      "made of my coming ! You will all be going \n",
      "soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . \n",
      "I met _one_ as I came -- Madness in such \n",
      "weather ! -- absolute madness ! '' Emma listened , \n",
      "and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's state \n",
      "might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being \n",
      "out of humour . Some people were always cross when \n",
      "they were hot . Such might be his constitution ; \n",
      "and as she knew that eating and drinking were often \n",
      "the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his \n",
      "taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every \n",
      "thing in the dining-room -- and she humanely pointed out \n",
      "the door . `` No -- he should not eat \n",
      ". He was not hungry ; it would only make \n",
      "him hotter . '' In two minutes , however , \n",
      "he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something \n",
      "about spruce-beer , walked off . Emma returned all her \n",
      "attention to her father , saying in secret -- '' \n",
      "I am glad I have done being in love with \n",
      "him . I should not like a man who is \n",
      "so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet 's \n",
      "sweet easy temper will not mind it . '' He \n",
      "was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable \n",
      "meal , and came back all the better -- grown \n",
      "quite cool -- and , with good manners , like \n",
      "himself -- able to draw a chair close to them \n",
      ", take an interest in their employment ; and regret \n",
      ", in a reasonable way , that he should be \n",
      "so late . He was not in his best spirits \n",
      ", but seemed trying to improve them ; and , \n",
      "at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably . \n",
      "They were looking over views in Swisserland . `` As \n",
      "soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go \n",
      "abroad , '' said he . `` I shall never \n",
      "be easy till I have seen some of these places \n",
      ". You will have my sketches , some time or \n",
      "other , to look at -- or my tour to \n",
      "read -- or my poem . I shall do something \n",
      "to expose myself . '' `` That may be -- \n",
      "but not by sketches in Swisserland . You will never \n",
      "go to Swisserland . Your uncle and aunt will never \n",
      "allow you to leave England . '' `` They may \n",
      "be induced to go too . A warm climate may \n",
      "be prescribed for her . I have more than half \n",

      "you I have . I feel a strong persuasion , \n",
      "this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . \n",
      "I ought to travel . I am tired of doing \n",
      "nothing . I want a change . I am serious \n",
      ", Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy \n",
      "-- I am sick of England -- and would leave \n",
      "it to-morrow , if I could . '' `` You \n",

      "invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented \n",
      "to stay ? '' `` _I_ sick of prosperity and \n",
      "indulgence ! You are quite mistaken . I do not \n",
      "look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . I \n",

      "consider myself at all a fortunate person . '' `` \n",
      "You are not quite so miserable , though , as \n",
      "when you first came . Go and eat and drink \n",
      "a little more , and you will do very well \n",
      ". Another slice of cold meat , another draught of \n",
      "Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a \n",

      "you . You are my best cure . '' `` \n",
      "We are going to Box Hill to-morrow ; -- you \n",
      "will join us . It is not Swisserland , but \n",
      "it will be something for a young man so much \n",
      "in want of a change . You will stay , \n",
      "and go with us ? '' `` No , certainly \n",
      "not ; I shall go home in the cool of \n",
      "the evening . '' `` But you may come again \n",
      "in the cool of to-morrow morning . '' `` No \n",
      "-- It will not be worth while . If I \n",
      "come , I shall be cross . '' `` Then \n",
      "pray stay at Richmond . '' `` But if I \n",
      "do , I shall be crosser still . I can \n",
      "never bear to think of you all there without me \n",
      ". '' `` These are difficulties which you must settle \n",
      "for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . \n",
      "I shall press you no more . '' The rest \n",
      "of the party were now returning , and all were \n",
      "soon collected . With some there was great joy at \n",
      "the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very \n",
      "composedly ; but there was a very general distress and \n",
      "disturbance on Miss Fairfax 's disappearance being explained . That \n",
      "it was time for every body to go , concluded \n",
      "the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for \n",
      "the next day 's scheme , they parted . Frank \n",
      "Churchill 's little inclination to exclude himself increased so much \n",
      ", that his last words to Emma were , '' \n",
      "Well ; -- if _you_ wish me to stay and \n",
      "join the party , I will . '' She smiled \n",
      "her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from \n",
      "Richmond was to take him back before the following evening \n",
      ". CHAPTER VII They had a very fine day for \n",
      "Box Hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of \n",
      "arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour \n",
      "of a pleasant party . Mr. Weston directed the whole \n",
      ", officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and \n",
      "every body was in good time . Emma and Harriet \n",
      "went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with \n",
      "the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback . Mrs. Weston \n",
      "remained with Mr. Woodhouse . Nothing was wanting but to \n",
      "be happy when they got there . Seven miles were \n",
      "travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had \n",
      "a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in \n",
      "the general amount of the day there was deficiency . \n",
      "There was a languor , a want of spirits , \n",
      "a want of union , which could not be got \n",
      "over . They separated too much into parties . The \n",
      "Eltons walked together ; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss \n",
      "Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to \n",
      "Frank Churchill . And Mr. Weston tried , in vain \n",
      ", to make them harmonise better . It seemed at \n",
      "first an accidental division , but it never materially varied \n",
      ". Mr. and Mrs. Elton , indeed , shewed no \n",
      "unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they \n",
      "could ; but during the two whole hours that were \n",
      "spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of \n",
      "separation , between the other parties , too strong for \n",
      "any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or \n",
      "any cheerful Mr. Weston , to remove . At first \n",
      "it was downright dulness to Emma . She had never \n",
      "seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid . He said \n",
      "nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without \n",
      "intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said . While \n",
      "he was so dull , it was no wonder that \n",
      "Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both \n",
      "insufferable . When they all sat down it was better \n",
      "; to her taste a great deal better , for \n",
      "Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his \n",
      "first object . Every distinguishing attention that could be paid \n",
      ", was paid to her . To amuse her , \n",
      "and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that \n",
      "he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be \n",
      "enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay \n",
      "and easy too , and gave him all the friendly \n",
      "encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she \n",
      "had ever given in the first and most animating period \n",
      "of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her \n",

      "a better creature in the world : but you must \n",
      "allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous \n",

      "if she live to old age , must probably sink \n",
      "more . Her situation should secure your compassion . It \n",

      "to me ; but I must , I will , \n",
      "-- I will tell you truths while I can ; \n",
      "satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel \n",

      "do me greater justice than you can do now . \n",
      "'' While they talked , they were advancing towards the \n",
      "carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she \n",
      "could speak again , he had handed her in . \n",
      "He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face \n",
      "averted , and her tongue motionless . They were combined \n",
      "only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep \n",
      "concern . She had not been able to speak ; \n",

      "sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager \n",
      "to shew a difference ; but it was just too \n",
      "late . He had turned away , and the horses \n",

      "unusual speed , they were half way down the hill \n",

      "what she could conceal . Never had she felt so \n",
      "agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in \n",
      "her life . She was most forcibly struck . The \n",
      "truth of this representation there was no denying . She \n",
      "felt it at her heart . How could she have \n",
      "been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates ! \n",
      "How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion \n",
      "in any one she valued ! And how suffer him \n",
      "to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , \n",
      "of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not \n",
      "compose her . As she reflected more , she seemed \n",
      "but to feel it more . She never had been \n",
      "so depressed . Happily it was not necessary to speak \n",
      ". There was only Harriet , who seemed not in \n",
      "spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be \n",
      "silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her \n",
      "cheeks almost all the way home , without being at \n",
      "any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were \n",
      ". CHAPTER VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box \n",
      "Hill was in Emma 's thoughts all the evening . \n",
      "How it might be considered by the rest of the \n",
      "party , she could not tell . They , in \n",
      "their different homes , and their different ways , might \n",

      "her view it was a morning more completely misspent , \n",
      "more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , \n",
      "and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any \n",
      "she had ever passed . A whole evening of back-gammon \n",
      "with her father , was felicity to it . _There_ \n",
      ", indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she \n",
      "was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to \n",
      "his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might \n",

      "joints -- I must go and see him to-day ; \n",
      "and so will Jane , I am sure , if \n",

      "be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank \n",
      "Churchill 's going , she proceeded to give them all \n",
      ", it was of no consequence . What Mr. Elton \n",

      "the accumulation of the ostler 's own knowledge , and \n",
      "the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , \n",
      "that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after \n",
      "the return of the party from Box Hill -- which \n",
      "messenger , however , had been no more than was \n",
      "expected ; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew \n",
      "a few lines , containing , upon the whole , \n",
      "a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill , and only wishing \n",
      "him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning \n",
      "early ; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to \n",
      "go home directly , without waiting at all , and \n",
      "his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom \n",
      "had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , \n",

      "by , the boy going a good pace , and \n",
      "driving very steady . There was nothing in all this \n",
      "either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma \n",
      "'s attention only as it united with the subject which \n",
      "already engaged her mind . The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's \n",
      "importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax 's , \n",
      "struck her ; one was every thing , the other \n",
      "nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of \n",
      "woman 's destiny , and quite unconscious on what her \n",
      "eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates 's \n",

      ", I do believe , she knows not whether it \n",
      "was his present or his daughter 's . '' Now \n",
      "Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and \n",
      "the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures \n",
      "was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself \n",

      ", with a repetition of every thing that she could \n",
      "venture to say of the good wishes which she really \n",

      "must now be gone directly . I am going to \n",
      "London , to spend a few days with John and \n",
      "Isabella . Have you any thing to send or say \n",
      ", besides the ` love , ' which nobody carries \n",
      "? '' `` Nothing at all . But is not \n",
      "this a sudden scheme ? '' `` Yes -- rather \n",
      "-- I have been thinking of it some little time \n",
      ". '' Emma was sure he had not forgiven her \n",
      "; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , \n",
      "she thought , would tell him that they ought to \n",
      "be friends again . While he stood , as if \n",
      "meaning to go , but not going -- her father \n",
      "began his inquiries . `` Well , my dear , \n",
      "and did you get there safely ? -- And how \n",
      "did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter \n",
      "? -- I dare say they must have been very \n",
      "much obliged to you for coming . Dear Emma has \n",
      "been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates , Mr. \n",
      "Knightley , as I told you before . She is \n",
      "always so attentive to them ! '' Emma 's colour \n",
      "was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a \n",
      "smile , and shake of the head , which spoke \n",
      "much , she looked at Mr . Knightley. -- It \n",
      "seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her \n",
      "favour , as if his eyes received the truth from \n",
      "her 's , and all that had passed of good \n",
      "in her feelings were at once caught and honoured. -- \n",
      "He looked at her with a glow of regard . \n",
      "She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still \n",
      "more so , by a little movement of more than \n",
      "common friendliness on his part. -- He took her hand \n",
      "; -- whether she had not herself made the first \n",
      "motion , she could not say -- she might , \n",
      "perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took \n",
      "her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on \n",
      "the point of carrying it to his lips -- when \n",
      ", from some fancy or other , he suddenly let \n",
      "it go. -- Why he should feel such a scruple \n",
      ", why he should change his mind when it was \n",
      "all but done , she could not perceive. -- He \n",
      "would have judged better , she thought , if he \n",
      "had not stopped. -- The intention , however , was \n",
      "indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had \n",
      "in general so little gallantry , or however else it \n",
      "happened , but she thought nothing became him more. -- \n",
      "It was with him , of so simple , yet \n",
      "so dignified a nature. -- She could not but recall \n",
      "the attempt with great satisfaction . It spoke such perfect \n",
      "amity. -- He left them immediately afterwards -- gone in \n",
      "a moment . He always moved with the alertness of \n",
      "a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , \n",
      "but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his \n",
      "disappearance . Emma could not regret her having gone to \n",
      "Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her \n",
      "ten minutes earlier ; -- it would have been a \n",
      "great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax 's situation with \n",
      "Mr . Knightley. -- Neither would she regret that he \n",
      "should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew \n",
      "how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it \n",
      "might have happened at a better time -- and to \n",
      "have had longer notice of it , would have been \n",
      "pleasanter. -- They parted thorough friends , however ; she \n",
      "could not be deceived as to the meaning of his \n",
      "countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ; -- it was \n",
      "all done to assure her that she had fully recovered \n",
      "his good opinion. -- He had been sitting with them \n",
      "half an hour , she found . It was a \n",
      "pity that she had not come back earlier ! In \n",
      "the hope of diverting her father 's thoughts from the \n",
      "disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley 's going to London ; and \n",
      "going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which \n",
      "she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated \n",
      "her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on \n",
      "the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful \n",
      "check , -- interested , without disturbing him . He \n",
      "had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax 's \n",
      "going out as governess , and could talk of it \n",
      "cheerfully , but Mr. Knightley 's going to London had \n",
      "been an unexpected blow . `` I am very glad \n",
      ", indeed , my dear , to hear she is \n",
      "to be so comfortably settled . Mrs. Elton is very \n",
      "good-natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance \n",
      "are just what they ought to be . I hope \n",
      "it is a dry situation , and that her health \n",
      "will be taken good care of . It ought to \n",
      "be a first object , as I am sure poor \n",
      "Miss Taylor 's always was with me . You know \n",
      ", my dear , she is going to be to \n",
      "this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us . \n",
      "And I hope she will be better off in one \n",
      "respect , and not be induced to go away after \n",
      "it has been her home so long . '' The \n",
      "following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing \n",
      "else into the background . An express arrived at Randalls \n",
      "to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill ! Though her \n",
      "nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on \n",
      "her account , she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours \n",
      "after his return . A sudden seizure of a different \n",
      "nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , \n",
      "had carried her off after a short struggle . The \n",
      "great Mrs. Churchill was no more . It was felt \n",
      "as such things must be felt . Every body had \n",
      "a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the \n",
      "departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , \n",
      "in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she \n",
      "would be buried . Goldsmith tells us , that when \n",
      "lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to \n",
      "do but to die ; and when she stoops to \n",
      "be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as \n",
      "a clearer of ill-fame . Mrs. Churchill , after being \n",
      "disliked at least twenty-five years , was now spoken of \n",
      "with compassionate allowances . In one point she was fully \n",
      "justified . She had never been admitted before to be \n",
      "seriously ill . The event acquitted her of all the \n",
      "fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . \n",
      "`` Poor Mrs. Churchill ! no doubt she had been \n",
      "suffering a great deal : more than any body had \n",
      "ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper \n",
      ". It was a sad event -- a great shock \n",
      "-- with all her faults , what would Mr. Churchill \n",
      "do without her ? Mr. Churchill 's loss would be \n",
      "dreadful indeed . Mr. Churchill would never get over it \n",
      ". '' -- Even Mr. Weston shook his head , \n",
      "and looked solemn , and said , '' Ah ! \n",
      "poor woman , who would have thought it ! '' \n",
      "and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome \n",
      "as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising \n",
      "over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense \n",
      ", true and steady . How it would affect Frank \n",
      "was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was \n",
      "also a very early speculation with Emma . The character \n",
      "of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- \n",
      "her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion \n",
      "-- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank \n",
      "might be affected by the event , how benefited , \n",
      "how freed . She saw in a moment all the \n",
      "possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith \n",
      "would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent \n",
      "of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an \n",
      "easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any \n",
      "thing by his nephew . All that remained to be \n",
      "wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment \n",
      ", as , with all her goodwill in the cause \n",
      ", Emma could feel no certainty of its being already \n",
      "formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , \n",
      "with great self-command . What ever she might feel of \n",
      "brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified \n",
      ", to observe such a proof in her of strengthened \n",
      "character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger \n",
      "its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. \n",
      "Churchill 's death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from \n",
      "Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was \n",
      "immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill \n",
      "was better than could be expected ; and their first \n",
      "removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire \n",
      ", was to be to the house of a very \n",
      "old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had \n",
      "been promising a visit the last ten years . At \n",
      "present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet \n",
      "; good wishes for the future were all that could \n",
      "yet be possible on Emma 's side . It was \n",
      "a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax \n",
      ", whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened \n",
      ", and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in \n",
      "any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her \n",
      "kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a \n",
      "first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than \n",
      "for her past coldness ; and the person , whom \n",
      "she had been so many months neglecting , was now \n",
      "the very one on whom she would have lavished every \n",
      "distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be \n",
      "of use to her ; wanted to shew a value \n",
      "for her society , and testify respect and consideration . \n",
      "She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day \n",
      "at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it \n",
      ". The invitation was refused , and by a verbal \n",
      "message . `` Miss Fairfax was not well enough to \n",
      "write ; '' and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield \n",
      ", the same morning , it appeared that she was \n",
      "so much indisposed as to have been visited , though \n",
      "against her own consent , by himself , and that \n",
      "she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous \n",
      "fever to a degree , which made him doubt the \n",
      "possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the \n",
      "time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely \n",
      "deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were \n",
      "no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint \n",
      ", which was the standing apprehension of the family , \n",
      "Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she \n",
      "had undertaken more than she was equal to , and \n",
      "that she felt it so herself , though she would \n",
      "not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her \n",
      "present home , he could not but observe , was \n",
      "unfavourable to a nervous disorder : -- confined always to \n",
      "one room ; -- he could have wished it otherwise \n",
      "-- and her good aunt , though his very old \n",
      "friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best \n",
      "companion for an invalid of that description . Her care \n",
      "and attention could not be questioned ; they were , \n",
      "in fact , only too great . He very much \n",
      "feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from \n",
      "them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved \n",
      "for her more and more , and looked around eager \n",
      "to discover some way of being useful . To take \n",
      "her -- be it only an hour or two -- \n",
      "from her aunt , to give her change of air \n",
      "and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for \n",
      "an hour or two , might do her good ; \n",
      "and the following morning she wrote again to say , \n",
      "in the most feeling language she could command , that \n",
      "she would call for her in the carriage at any \n",
      "hour that Jane would name -- mentioning that she had \n",
      "Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such \n",
      "exercise for his patient . The answer was only in \n",
      "this short note : '' Miss Fairfax 's compliments and \n",
      "thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise . \n",
      "'' Emma felt that her own note had deserved something \n",
      "better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words \n",
      ", whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and \n",
      "she thought only of how she might best counteract this \n",
      "unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of \n",
      "the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , \n",
      "and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope \n",
      "that Jane would be induced to join her -- but \n",
      "it would not do ; -- Miss Bates came to \n",
      "the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with \n",
      "her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of \n",
      "the greatest service -- and every thing that message could \n",
      "do was tried -- but all in vain . Miss \n",
      "Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was \n",
      "quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed \n",
      "to make her worse. -- Emma wished she could have \n",
      "seen her , and tried her own powers ; but \n",
      ", almost before she could hint the wish , Miss \n",
      "Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece \n",
      "on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . `` \n",
      "Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane \n",
      "could not bear to see any body -- any body \n",
      "at all -- Mrs. Elton , indeed , could not \n",
      "be denied -- and Mrs. Cole had made such a \n",
      "point -- and Mrs. Perry had said so much -- \n",
      "but , except them , Jane would really see nobody \n",
      ". '' Emma did not want to be classed with \n",
      "the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the \n",
      "Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither \n",
      "could she feel any right of preference herself -- she \n",
      "submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther \n",
      "as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which \n",
      "she longed to be able to assist . On that \n",
      "subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very \n",
      "communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing : -- \n",
      "Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they \n",
      "could command ( and never had any body such good \n",
      "neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home \n",
      ", called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of \n",
      "her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality \n",
      "was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly \n",
      "note . In half an hour the arrowroot was returned \n",
      ", with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but \n",
      "`` dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being \n",
      "sent back ; it was a thing she could not \n",
      "take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her \n",
      "saying , that she was not at all in want \n",
      "of any thing . '' When Emma afterwards heard that \n",
      "Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , \n",
      "at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of \n",
      "the very day on which she had , under the \n",
      "plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily \n",
      "refused to go out with her in the carriage , \n",
      "she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together \n",
      "-- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from \n",
      "_her_ . She was sorry , very sorry . Her \n",
      "heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the \n",
      "more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , \n",
      "inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and \n",
      "it mortified her that she was given so little credit \n",
      "for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as \n",
      "a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing \n",
      "that her intentions were good , and of being able \n",
      "to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have \n",
      "been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax \n",
      ", could he even have seen into her heart , \n",
      "he would not , on this occasion , have found \n",
      "any thing to reprove . CHAPTER X One morning , \n",
      "about ten days after Mrs. Churchill 's decease , Emma \n",
      "was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who `` could \n",
      "not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak \n",
      "with her . '' -- He met her at the \n",
      "parlour-door , and hardly asking her how she did , \n",
      "in the natural key of his voice , sunk it \n",
      "immediately , to say , unheard by her father , \n",
      "'' Can you come to Randalls at any time this \n",
      "morning ? -- Do , if it be possible . \n",
      "Mrs. Weston wants to see you . She must see \n",
      "you . '' `` Is she unwell ? '' `` \n",
      "No , no , not at all -- only a \n",
      "little agitated . She would have ordered the carriage , \n",
      "and come to you , but she must see you \n",
      "_alone_ , and that you know -- ( nodding towards \n",
      "her father ) -- Humph ! -- Can you come \n",
      "? '' `` Certainly . This moment , if you \n",
      "please . It is impossible to refuse what you ask \n",
      "in such a way . But what can be the \n",
      "matter ? -- Is she really not ill ? '' \n",
      "`` Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions \n",
      ". You will know it all in time . The \n",
      "most unaccountable business ! But hush , hush ! '' \n",
      "To guess what all this meant , was impossible even \n",
      "for Emma . Something really important seemed announced by his \n",
      "looks ; but , as her friend was well , \n",
      "she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it \n",
      "with her father , that she would take her walk \n",
      "now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of \n",
      "the house together and on their way at a quick \n",
      "pace for Randalls . `` Now , '' -- said \n",
      "Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates \n",
      ", -- '' now Mr. Weston , do let me \n",
      "know what has happened . '' `` No , no \n",
      ", '' -- he gravely replied. -- '' Do n't \n",
      "ask me . I promised my wife to leave it \n",
      "all to her . She will break it to you \n",
      "better than I can . Do not be impatient , \n",
      "Emma ; it will all come out too soon . \n",
      "'' `` Break it to me , '' cried Emma \n",
      ", standing still with terror. -- '' Good God ! \n",
      "-- Mr . Weston , tell me at once. -- \n",
      "Something has happened in Brunswick Square . I know it \n",
      "has . Tell me , I charge you tell me \n",
      "this moment what it is . '' `` No , \n",
      "indeed you are mistaken . '' -- '' Mr. Weston \n",
      "do not trifle with me. -- Consider how many of \n",
      "my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square . Which \n",
      "of them is it ? -- I charge you by \n",
      "all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment . \n",
      "'' `` Upon my word , Emma . '' -- \n",
      "'' Your word ! -- why not your honour ! \n",
      "-- why not say upon your honour , that it \n",
      "has nothing to do with any of them ? Good \n",
      "Heavens ! -- What can be to be _broke_ to \n",
      "me , that does not relate to one of that \n",
      "family ? '' `` Upon my honour , '' said \n",
      "he very seriously , `` it does not . It \n",
      "is not in the smallest degree connected with any human \n",
      "being of the name of Knightley . '' Emma 's \n",
      "courage returned , and she walked on . `` I \n",
      "was wrong , '' he continued , `` in talking \n",
      "of its being _broke_ to you . I should not \n",
      "have used the expression . In fact , it does \n",
      "not concern you -- it concerns only myself , -- \n",
      "that is , we hope. -- Humph ! -- In \n",
      "short , my dear Emma , there is no occasion \n",
      "to be so uneasy about it . I do n't \n",
      "say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but \n",
      "things might be much worse. -- If we walk fast \n",
      ", we shall soon be at Randalls . '' Emma \n",
      "found that she must wait ; and now it required \n",
      "little effort . She asked no more questions therefore , \n",
      "merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed \n",
      "out to her the probability of its being some money \n",
      "concern -- something just come to light , of a \n",
      "disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family , -- \n",
      "something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward \n",
      ". Her fancy was very active . Half a dozen \n",
      "natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off \n",
      "! -- This , though very undesirable , would be \n",
      "no matter of agony to her . It inspired little \n",
      "more than an animating curiosity . `` Who is that \n",
      "gentleman on horseback ? '' said she , as they \n",
      "proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping \n",
      "his secret , than with any other view . `` \n",
      "I do not know. -- One of the Otways. -- \n",
      "Not Frank ; -- it is not Frank , I \n",
      "assure you . You will not see him . He \n",
      "is half way to Windsor by this time . '' \n",
      "`` Has your son been with you , then ? \n",
      "'' `` Oh ! yes -- did not you know \n",
      "? -- Well , well , never mind . '' \n",
      "For a moment he was silent ; and then added \n",
      ", in a tone much more guarded and demure , \n",
      "'' Yes , Frank came over this morning , just \n",
      "to ask us how we did . '' They hurried \n",
      "on , and were speedily at Randalls. -- '' Well \n",
      ", my dear , '' said he , as they \n",
      "entered the room -- '' I have brought her , \n",
      "and now I hope you will soon be better . \n",
      "I shall leave you together . There is no use \n",
      "in delay . I shall not be far off , \n",
      "if you want me . '' -- And Emma distinctly \n",
      "heard him add , in a lower tone , before \n",
      "he quitted the room , -- '' I have been \n",
      "as good as my word . She has not the \n",
      "least idea . '' Mrs. Weston was looking so ill \n",
      ", and had an air of so much perturbation , \n",
      "that Emma 's uneasiness increased ; and the moment they \n",
      "were alone , she eagerly said , '' What is \n",
      "it my dear friend ? Something of a very unpleasant \n",
      "nature , I find , has occurred ; -- do \n",
      "let me know directly what it is . I have \n",
      "been walking all this way in complete suspense . We \n",
      "both abhor suspense . Do not let mine continue longer \n",
      ". It will do you good to speak of your \n",
      "distress , whatever it may be . '' `` Have \n",
      "you indeed no idea ? '' said Mrs. Weston in \n",
      "a trembling voice . `` Can not you , my \n",
      "dear Emma -- can not you form a guess as \n",
      "to what you are to hear ? '' `` So \n",
      "far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill , \n",
      "I do guess . '' `` You are right . \n",
      "It does relate to him , and I will tell \n",
      "you directly ; '' ( resuming her work , and \n",
      "seeming resolved against looking up . ) `` He has \n",
      "been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary \n",
      "errand . It is impossible to express our surprize . \n",
      "He came to speak to his father on a subject \n",
      ", -- to announce an attachment -- '' She stopped \n",
      "to breathe . Emma thought first of herself , and \n",
      "then of Harriet . `` More than an attachment , \n",
      "indeed , '' resumed Mrs. Weston ; `` an engagement \n",
      "-- a positive engagement. -- What will you say , \n",
      "Emma -- what will any body say , when it \n",
      "is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged \n",
      "; -- nay , that they have been long engaged \n",
      "! '' Emma even jumped with surprize ; -- and \n",
      ", horror-struck , exclaimed , '' Jane Fairfax ! -- \n",
      "Good God ! You are not serious ? You do \n",
      "not mean it ? '' `` You may well be \n",
      "amazed , '' returned Mrs. Weston , still averting her \n",
      "eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma \n",
      "might have time to recover -- '' You may well \n",
      "be amazed . But it is even so . There \n",
      "has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October \n",
      "-- formed at Weymouth , and kept a secret from \n",
      "every body . Not a creature knowing it but themselves \n",
      "-- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor \n",
      "his. -- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly \n",
      "convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible \n",
      "to myself . I can hardly believe it. -- I \n",
      "thought I knew him . '' Emma scarcely heard what \n",
      "was said. -- Her mind was divided between two ideas \n",
      "-- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax \n",
      "; and poor Harriet ; -- and for some time \n",
      "she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated \n",
      "confirmation . `` Well , '' said she at last \n",
      ", trying to recover herself ; `` this is a \n",
      "circumstance which I must think of at least half a \n",
      "day , before I can at all comprehend it . \n",
      "What ! -- engaged to her all the winter -- \n",
      "before either of them came to Highbury ? '' `` \n",
      "Engaged since October , -- secretly engaged. -- It has \n",
      "hurt me , Emma , very much . It has \n",
      "hurt his father equally . _Some_ _part_ of his conduct \n",
      "we can not excuse . '' Emma pondered a moment \n",
      ", and then replied , `` I will not pretend \n",
      "_not_ to understand you ; and to give you all \n",
      "the relief in my power , be assured that no \n",
      "such effect has followed his attentions to me , as \n",
      "you are apprehensive of . '' Mrs. Weston looked up \n",
      ", afraid to believe ; but Emma 's countenance was \n",
      "as steady as her words . `` That you may \n",
      "have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my \n",
      "present perfect indifference , '' she continued , `` I \n",
      "will farther tell you , that there was a period \n",
      "in the early part of our acquaintance , when I \n",
      "did like him , when I was very much disposed \n",
      "to be attached to him -- nay , was attached \n",
      "-- and how it came to cease , is perhaps \n",
      "the wonder . Fortunately , however , it did cease \n",
      ". I have really for some time past , for \n",
      "at least these three months , cared nothing about him \n",
      ". You may believe me , Mrs. Weston . This \n",
      "is the simple truth . '' Mrs. Weston kissed her \n",
      "with tears of joy ; and when she could find \n",
      "utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done \n",
      "her more good than any thing else in the world \n",
      "could do . `` Mr. Weston will be almost as \n",
      "much relieved as myself , '' said she . `` \n",
      "On this point we have been wretched . It was \n",
      "our darling wish that you might be attached to each \n",
      "other -- and we were persuaded that it was so. \n",
      "-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account \n",
      ". '' `` I have escaped ; and that I \n",
      "should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder \n",
      "to you and myself . But this does not acquit \n",
      "_him_ , Mrs. Weston ; and I must say , \n",
      "that I think him greatly to blame . What right \n",
      "had he to come among us with affection and faith \n",
      "engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ? What \n",
      "right had he to endeavour to please , as he \n",
      "certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with \n",
      "persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he \n",
      "really belonged to another ? -- How could he tell \n",
      "what mischief he might be doing ? -- How could \n",
      "he tell that he might not be making me in \n",
      "love with him ? -- very wrong , very wrong \n",
      "indeed . '' `` From something that he said , \n",
      "my dear Emma , I rather imagine -- '' '' \n",
      "And how could _she_ bear such behaviour ! Composure with \n",
      "a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions \n",
      "were offering to another woman , before her face , \n",
      "and not resent it. -- That is a degree of \n",
      "placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect . \n",
      "'' `` There were misunderstandings between them , Emma ; \n",
      "he said so expressly . He had not time to \n",
      "enter into much explanation . He was here only a \n",
      "quarter of an hour , and in a state of \n",
      "agitation which did not allow the full use even of \n",
      "the time he could stay -- but that there had \n",
      "been misunderstandings he decidedly said . The present crisis , \n",
      "indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; \n",
      "and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety \n",
      "of his conduct . '' `` Impropriety ! Oh ! \n",
      "Mrs. Weston -- it is too calm a censure . \n",
      "Much , much beyond impropriety ! -- It has sunk \n",
      "him , I can not say how it has sunk \n",

      "Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with \n",

      "more necessary than ever , that , as I tell \n",
      "you , he could stay with us but a quarter \n",

      "very much , indeed -- to a degree that made \n",
      "him appear quite a different creature from any thing I \n",

      "his having been feeling a great deal . '' `` \n",
      "And do you really believe the affair to have been \n",

      "I shall always think it a very abominable sort of \n",
      "proceeding . What has it been but a system of \n",
      "hypocrisy and deceit , -- espionage , and treachery ? \n",
      "-- To come among us with professions of openness and \n",
      "simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge \n",
      "us all ! -- Here have we been , the \n",
      "whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves \n",
      "all on an equal footing of truth and honour , \n",
      "with two people in the midst of us who may \n",
      "have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment \n",
      "on sentiments and words that were never meant for both \n",
      "to hear. -- They must take the consequence , if \n",
      "they have heard each other spoken of in a way \n",
      "not perfectly agreeable ! '' `` I am quite easy \n",
      "on that head , '' replied Mrs. Weston . `` \n",

      "not a connexion to gratify ; but if Mr. Churchill \n",
      "does not feel that , why should we ? and \n",
      "it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , \n",
      "for Frank , I mean , that he should have \n",
      "attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character \n",
      "and good judgment as I have always given her credit \n",
      "for -- and still am disposed to give her credit \n",
      "for , in spite of this one great deviation from \n",

      "'' `` Much , indeed ! '' cried Emma feelingly \n",
      ". `` If a woman can ever be excused for \n",
      "thinking only of herself , it is in a situation \n",
      "like Jane Fairfax's. -- Of such , one may almost \n",
      "say , that ` the world is not their 's \n",
      ", nor the world 's law . ' '' She \n",
      "met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling \n",
      "countenance , exclaiming , '' A very pretty trick you \n",
      "have been playing me , upon my word ! This \n",
      "was a device , I suppose , to sport with \n",
      "my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing . \n",
      "But you really frightened me . I thought you had \n",
      "lost half your property , at least . And here \n",
      ", instead of its being a matter of condolence , \n",
      "it turns out to be one of congratulation. -- I \n",
      "congratulate you , Mr. Weston , with all my heart \n",
      ", on the prospect of having one of the most \n",
      "lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter \n",
      ". '' A glance or two between him and his \n",
      "wife , convinced him that all was as right as \n",
      "this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his \n",
      "spirits was immediate . His air and voice recovered their \n",
      "usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by \n",
      "the hand , and entered on the subject in a \n",
      "manner to prove , that he now only wanted time \n",
      "and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing \n",
      ". His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , \n",
      "or smooth objections ; and by the time they had \n",
      "talked it all over together , and he had talked \n",
      "it all over again with Emma , in their walk \n",
      "back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , \n",
      "and not far from thinking it the very best thing \n",
      "that Frank could possibly have done . CHAPTER XI '' \n",
      "Harriet , poor Harriet ! '' -- Those were the \n",
      "words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma \n",
      "could not get rid of , and which constituted the \n",
      "real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill \n",
      "had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in \n",
      "many ways , -- but it was not so much \n",
      "_his_ behaviour as her _own_ , which made her so \n",
      "angry with him . It was the scrape which he \n",
      "had drawn her into on Harriet 's account , that \n",
      "gave the deepest hue to his offence. -- Poor Harriet \n",
      "! to be a second time the dupe of her \n",
      "misconceptions and flattery . Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , \n",
      "when he once said , `` Emma , you have \n",
      "been no friend to Harriet Smith . '' -- She \n",
      "was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice. -- \n",
      "It was true that she had not to charge herself \n",
      ", in this instance as in the former , with \n",
      "being the sole and original author of the mischief ; \n",
      "with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have \n",
      "entered Harriet 's imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her \n",
      "admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever \n",
      "given her a hint on the subject ; but she \n",
      "felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have \n",
      "repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase \n",
      "of such sentiments . Her influence would have been enough \n",
      ". And now she was very conscious that she ought \n",
      "to have prevented them. -- She felt that she had \n",
      "been risking her friend 's happiness on most insufficient grounds \n",
      ". Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet \n",
      ", that she must not allow herself to think of \n",
      "him , and that there were five hundred chances to \n",
      "one against his ever caring for her. -- '' But \n",
      ", with common sense , '' she added , `` \n",
      "I am afraid I have had little to do . \n",
      "'' She was extremely angry with herself . If she \n",
      "could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , \n",
      "it would have been dreadful. -- As for Jane Fairfax \n",
      ", she might at least relieve her feelings from any \n",
      "present solicitude on her account . Harriet would be anxiety \n",
      "enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane \n",
      ", whose troubles and whose ill-health having , of course \n",
      ", the same origin , must be equally under cure. \n",
      "-- Her days of insignificance and evil were over. -- \n",
      "She would soon be well , and happy , and \n",
      "prosperous. -- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions \n",
      "had been slighted . This discovery laid many smaller matters \n",
      "open . No doubt it had been from jealousy. -- \n",
      "In Jane 's eyes she had been a rival ; \n",
      "and well might any thing she could offer of assistance \n",
      "or regard be repulsed . An airing in the Hartfield \n",
      "carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from \n",
      "the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison . She understood \n",
      "it all ; and as far as her mind could \n",
      "disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings \n",
      ", she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation \n",
      "nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was \n",
      "such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to \n",
      "be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly \n",
      "fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than \n",
      "the first . Considering the very superior claims of the \n",
      "object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently \n",
      "stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and \n",
      "self-command , it would. -- She must communicate the painful \n",
      "truth , however , and as soon as possible . \n",
      "An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting \n",
      "words . `` For the present , the whole affair \n",
      "was to be completely a secret . Mr. Churchill had \n",
      "made a point of it , as a token of \n",
      "respect to the wife he had so very recently lost \n",
      "; and every body admitted it to be no more \n",
      "than due decorum . '' -- Emma had promised ; \n",
      "but still Harriet must be excepted . It was her \n",
      "superior duty . In spite of her vexation , she \n",
      "could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she \n",
      "should have the very same distressing and delicate office to \n",
      "perform by Harriet , which Mrs. Weston had just gone \n",
      "through by herself . The intelligence , which had been \n",
      "so anxiously announced to her , she was now to \n",
      "be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick \n",
      "on hearing Harriet 's footstep and voice ; so , \n",
      "she supposed , had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ \n",
      "was approaching Randalls . Could the event of the disclosure \n",
      "bear an equal resemblance ! -- But of that , \n",
      "unfortunately , there could be no chance . `` Well \n",
      ", Miss Woodhouse ! '' cried Harriet , coming eagerly \n",
      "into the room -- '' is not this the oddest \n",
      "news that ever was ? '' `` What news do \n",
      "you mean ? '' replied Emma , unable to guess \n",
      ", by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed \n",
      "have received any hint . `` About Jane Fairfax . \n",
      "Did you ever hear any thing so strange ? Oh \n",
      "! -- you need not be afraid of owning it \n",
      "to me , for Mr. Weston has told me himself \n",
      ". I met him just now . He told me \n",
      "it was to be a great secret ; and , \n",
      "therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to \n",
      "any body but you , but he said you knew \n",
      "it . '' `` What did Mr. Weston tell you \n",
      "? '' -- said Emma , still perplexed . `` \n",
      "Oh ! he told me all about it ; that \n",
      "Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married \n",
      ", and that they have been privately engaged to one \n",
      "another this long while . How very odd ! '' \n",
      "It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet 's \n",
      "behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not \n",
      "know how to understand it . Her character appeared absolutely \n",
      "changed . She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , \n",
      "or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . \n",
      "Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak . \n",
      "`` Had you any idea , '' cried Harriet , \n",
      "`` of his being in love with her ? -- \n",
      "You , perhaps , might. -- You ( blushing as \n",
      "she spoke ) who can see into every body 's \n",
      "heart ; but nobody else -- '' '' Upon my \n",
      "word , '' said Emma , `` I begin to \n",
      "doubt my having any such talent . Can you seriously \n",
      "ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached \n",
      "to another woman at the very time that I was \n",
      "-- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to \n",
      "give way to your own feelings ? -- I never \n",
      "had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour \n",
      ", of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard \n",
      "for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that \n",
      "if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly \n",
      ". '' `` Me ! '' cried Harriet , colouring \n",
      ", and astonished . `` Why should you caution me \n",
      "? -- You do not think I care about Mr. \n",
      "Frank Churchill . '' `` I am delighted to hear \n",
      "you speak so stoutly on the subject , '' replied \n",
      "Emma , smiling ; `` but you do not mean \n",
      "to deny that there was a time -- and not \n",
      "very distant either -- when you gave me reason to \n",
      "understand that you did care about him ? '' `` \n",
      "Him ! -- never , never . Dear Miss Woodhouse \n",
      ", how could you so mistake me ? '' turning \n",
      "away distressed . `` Harriet ! '' cried Emma , \n",
      "after a moment 's pause -- '' What do you \n",
      "mean ? -- Good Heaven ! what do you mean \n",
      "? -- Mistake you ! -- Am I to suppose \n",
      "then ? -- '' She could not speak another word. \n",
      "-- Her voice was lost ; and she sat down \n",
      ", waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer . \n",
      "Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and \n",
      "with face turned from her , did not immediately say \n",
      "any thing ; and when she did speak , it \n",
      "was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma 's \n",
      ". `` I should not have thought it possible , \n",
      "'' she began , `` that you could have misunderstood \n",
      "me ! I know we agreed never to name him \n",
      "-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every \n",
      "body else , I should not have thought it possible \n",
      "that I could be supposed to mean any other person \n",
      ". Mr. Frank Churchill , indeed ! I do not \n",
      "know who would ever look at him in the company \n",
      "of the other . I hope I have a better \n",
      "taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill , who \n",
      "is like nobody by his side . And that you \n",
      "should have been so mistaken , is amazing ! -- \n",
      "I am sure , but for believing that you entirely \n",
      "approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , \n",
      "I should have considered it at first too great a \n",
      "presumption almost , to dare to think of him . \n",
      "At first , if you had not told me that \n",
      "more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been \n",
      "matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words \n",
      ") ; -- I should not have dared to give \n",
      "way to -- I should not have thought it possible \n",
      "-- But if _you_ , who had been always acquainted \n",
      "with him -- '' '' Harriet ! '' cried Emma \n",
      ", collecting herself resolutely -- '' Let us understand each \n",
      "other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . \n",
      "Are you speaking of -- Mr . Knightley ? '' \n",
      "`` To be sure I am . I never could \n",
      "have an idea of any body else -- and so \n",
      "I thought you knew . When we talked about him \n",
      ", it was as clear as possible . '' `` \n",
      "Not quite , '' returned Emma , with forced calmness \n",
      ", `` for all that you then said , appeared \n",
      "to me to relate to a different person . I \n",
      "could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill \n",
      ". I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had \n",
      "rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , \n",
      "was spoken of . '' `` Oh ! Miss Woodhouse \n",
      ", how you do forget ! '' `` My dear \n",
      "Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I \n",
      "said on the occasion . I told you that I \n",
      "did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the \n",
      "service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural \n",
      ": -- and you agreed to it , expressing yourself \n",
      "very warmly as to your sense of that service , \n",
      "and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing \n",
      "him come forward to your rescue. -- The impression of \n",
      "it is strong on my memory . '' `` Oh \n",
      ", dear , '' cried Harriet , `` now I \n",
      "recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of \n",
      "something very different at the time . It was not \n",
      "the gipsies -- it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that \n",
      "I meant . No ! ( with some elevation ) \n",
      "I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- \n",
      "of Mr. Knightley 's coming and asking me to dance \n",
      ", when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me \n",
      "; and when there was no other partner in the \n",
      "room . That was the kind action ; that was \n",
      "the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service \n",
      "which made me begin to feel how superior he was \n",
      "to every other being upon earth . '' `` Good \n",
      "God ! '' cried Emma , `` this has been \n",
      "a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake ! -- What \n",
      "is to be done ? '' `` You would not \n",
      "have encouraged me , then , if you had understood \n",
      "me ? At least , however , I can not \n",
      "be worse off than I should have been , if \n",
      "the other had been the person ; and now -- \n",
      "it _is_ possible -- '' She paused a few moments \n",
      ". Emma could not speak . `` I do not \n",
      "wonder , Miss Woodhouse , '' she resumed , `` \n",
      "that you should feel a great difference between the two \n",
      ", as to me or as to any body . \n",
      "You must think one five hundred million times more above \n",
      "me than the other . But I hope , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if -- strange as \n",
      "it may appear -- . But you know they were \n",
      "your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened \n",
      ", matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between \n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , \n",
      "it seems as if such a thing even as this \n",
      ", may have occurred before -- and if I should \n",
      "be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to -- \n",
      "if Mr. Knightley should really -- if _he_ does not \n",
      "mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse \n",
      ", you will not set yourself against it , and \n",
      "try to put difficulties in the way . But you \n",
      "are too good for that , I am sure . \n",
      "'' Harriet was standing at one of the windows . \n",
      "Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , \n",
      "and hastily said , '' Have you any idea of \n",
      "Mr. Knightley 's returning your affection ? '' `` Yes \n",
      ", '' replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully -- \n",
      "'' I must say that I have . '' Emma \n",
      "'s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently \n",
      "meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few \n",
      "minutes . A few minutes were sufficient for making her \n",
      "acquainted with her own heart . A mind like hers \n",
      ", once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress . \n",
      "She touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole \n",
      "truth . Why was it so much worse that Harriet \n",
      "should be in love with Mr. Knightley , than with \n",
      "Frank Churchill ? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased \n",
      "by Harriet 's having some hope of a return ? \n",
      "It darted through her , with the speed of an \n",
      "arrow , that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but \n",
      "herself ! Her own conduct , as well as her \n",
      "own heart , was before her in the same few \n",
      "minutes . She saw it all with a clearness which \n",
      "had never blessed her before . How improperly had she \n",
      "been acting by Harriet ! How inconsiderate , how indelicate \n",
      ", how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct \n",
      "! What blindness , what madness , had led her \n",
      "on ! It struck her with dreadful force , and \n",
      "she was ready to give it every bad name in \n",
      "the world . Some portion of respect for herself , \n",
      "however , in spite of all these demerits -- some \n",
      "concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense \n",
      "of justice by Harriet -- ( there would be no \n",
      "need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved \n",
      "by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should \n",
      "not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) \n",
      "gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with \n",
      "calmness , with even apparent kindness. -- For her own \n",
      "advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent \n",
      "of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and \n",
      "Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest \n",
      "which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or \n",
      "to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose \n",
      "counsels had never led her right. -- Rousing from reflection \n",
      ", therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned \n",
      "to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting \n",
      "accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the \n",
      "subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story \n",
      "of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost. \n",
      "-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and \n",
      "themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no \n",
      "unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called \n",
      "from it , by the now encouraging manner of such \n",
      "a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse \n",
      ", and only wanted invitation , to give the history \n",
      "of her hopes with great , though trembling delight. -- \n",
      "Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she \n",
      "listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but \n",
      "they were not less . Her voice was not unsteady \n",
      "; but her mind was in all the perturbation that \n",
      "such a development of self , such a burst of \n",
      "threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing \n",
      "emotions , must create. -- She listened with much inward \n",
      "suffering , but with great outward patience , to Harriet \n",
      "'s detail. -- Methodical , or well arranged , or \n",
      "very well delivered , it could not be expected to \n",
      "be ; but it contained , when separated from all \n",
      "the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance \n",
      "to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances \n",
      ", which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. \n",
      "Knightley 's most improved opinion of Harriet . Harriet had \n",
      "been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since \n",
      "those two decisive dances. -- Emma knew that he had \n",
      ", on that occasion , found her much superior to \n",
      "his expectation . From that evening , or at least \n",
      "from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to \n",
      "think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible \n",
      "of his talking to her much more than he had \n",
      "been used to do , and of his having indeed \n",
      "quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of \n",
      "kindness and sweetness ! -- Latterly she had been more \n",
      "and more aware of it . When they had been \n",
      "all walking together , he had so often come and \n",
      "walked by her , and talked so very delightfully ! \n",
      "-- He seemed to want to be acquainted with her \n",
      ". Emma knew it to have been very much the \n",
      "case . She had often observed the change , to \n",
      "almost the same extent. -- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation \n",
      "and praise from him -- and Emma felt them to \n",
      "be in the closest agreement with what she had known \n",
      "of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for \n",
      "being without art or affectation , for having simple , \n",
      "honest , generous , feelings. -- She knew that he \n",
      "saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on \n",
      "them to her more than once. -- Much that lived \n",
      "in Harriet 's memory , many little particulars of the \n",
      "notice she had received from him , a look , \n",
      "a speech , a removal from one chair to another \n",
      ", a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had \n",
      "been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma . Circumstances \n",
      "that might swell to half an hour 's relation , \n",
      "and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them \n",
      ", had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them \n",
      "; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , \n",
      "the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not \n",
      "without some degree of witness from Emma herself. -- The \n",
      "first , was his walking with her apart from the \n",
      "others , in the lime-walk at Donwell , where they \n",
      "had been walking some time before Emma came , and \n",
      "he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) \n",
      "to draw her from the rest to himself -- and \n",
      "at first , he had talked to her in a \n",
      "more particular way than he had ever done before , \n",
      "in a very particular way indeed ! -- ( Harriet \n",
      "could not recall it without a blush . ) He \n",
      "seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections \n",
      "were engaged. -- But as soon as she ( Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed \n",
      "the subject , and began talking about farming : -- \n",
      "The second , was his having sat talking with her \n",
      "nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her \n",
      "visit , the very last morning of his being at \n",
      "Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , \n",
      "he had said that he could not stay five minutes \n",
      "-- and his having told her , during their conversation \n",
      ", that though he must go to London , it \n",
      "was very much against his inclination that he left home \n",
      "at all , which was much more ( as Emma \n",
      "felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ . The \n",
      "superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one \n",
      "article marked , gave her severe pain . On the \n",
      "subject of the first of the two circumstances , she \n",
      "did , after a little reflection , venture the following \n",
      "question . `` Might he not ? -- Is not \n",
      "it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought \n",
      ", into the state of your affections , he might \n",
      "be alluding to Mr. Martin -- he might have Mr. \n",
      "Martin 's interest in view ? But Harriet rejected the \n",
      "suspicion with spirit . `` Mr. Martin ! No indeed \n",
      "! -- There was not a hint of Mr. Martin \n",
      ". I hope I know better now , than to \n",
      "care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of \n",
      "it . '' When Harriet had closed her evidence , \n",
      "she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say \n",
      "whether she had not good ground for hope . `` \n",
      "I never should have presumed to think of it at \n",
      "first , '' said she , '' but for you \n",
      ". You told me to observe him carefully , and \n",
      "let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and \n",
      "so I have . But now I seem to feel \n",
      "that I may deserve him ; and that if he \n",
      "does chuse me , it will not be any thing \n",
      "so very wonderful . '' The bitter feelings occasioned by \n",
      "this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the \n",
      "utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable \n",
      "her to say on reply , '' Harriet , I \n",
      "will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is \n",
      "the last man in the world , who would intentionally \n",
      "give any woman the idea of his feeling for her \n",
      "more than he really does . '' Harriet seemed ready \n",
      "to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; \n",
      "and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , \n",
      "which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , \n",
      "by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He \n",
      "was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much \n",
      "agitated to encounter him . `` She could not compose \n",
      "herself -- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had \n",
      "better go ; '' -- with most ready encouragement from \n",
      "her friend , therefore , she passed off through another \n",
      "door -- and the moment she was gone , this \n",
      "was the spontaneous burst of Emma 's feelings : `` \n",
      "Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! \n",
      "'' The rest of the day , the following night \n",
      ", were hardly enough for her thoughts. -- She was \n",
      "bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on \n",
      "her within the last few hours . Every moment had \n",
      "brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be \n",
      "matter of humiliation to her. -- How to understand it \n",
      "all ! How to understand the deceptions she had been \n",
      "thus practising on herself , and living under ! -- \n",
      "The blunders , the blindness of her own head and \n",
      "heart ! -- she sat still , she walked about \n",
      ", she tried her own room , she tried the \n",
      "shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she \n",
      "perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she \n",
      "had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying \n",
      "degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in \n",
      "a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched \n",
      ", and should probably find this day but the beginning \n",
      "of wretchedness . To understand , thoroughly understand her own \n",
      "heart , was the first endeavour . To that point \n",
      "went every leisure moment which her father 's claims on \n",
      "her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of \n",
      "mind . How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear \n",
      "to her , as every feeling declared him now to \n",
      "be ? When had his influence , such influence begun \n",
      "? -- When had he succeeded to that place in \n",
      "her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for \n",
      "a short period , occupied ? -- She looked back \n",
      "; she compared the two -- compared them , as \n",
      "they had always stood in her estimation , from the \n",
      "time of the latter 's becoming known to her -- \n",
      "and as they must at any time have been compared \n",
      "by her , had it -- oh ! had it \n",
      ", by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , \n",
      "to institute the comparison. -- She saw that there never \n",
      "had been a time when she did not consider Mr. \n",
      "Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard \n",
      "for her had not been infinitely the most dear . \n",
      "She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying \n",
      ", in acting to the contrary , she had been \n",
      "entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own \n",
      "heart -- and , in short , that she had \n",
      "never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This \n",
      "was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . \n",
      "This was the knowledge of herself , on the first \n",
      "question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without \n",
      "being long in reaching it. -- She was most sorrowfully \n",
      "indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed \n",
      "to her -- her affection for Mr . Knightley. -- \n",
      "Every other part of her mind was disgusting . With \n",
      "insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of \n",
      "every body 's feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to \n",
      "arrange every body 's destiny . She was proved to \n",
      "have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite \n",
      "done nothing -- for she had done mischief . She \n",
      "had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and \n",
      "she too much feared , on Mr . Knightley. -- \n",
      "Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place \n",
      ", on her must rest all the reproach of having \n",
      "given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she \n",
      "must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of \n",
      "Harriet 's ; -- and even were this not the \n",
      "case , he would never have known Harriet at all \n",
      "but for her folly . Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith \n",
      "! -- It was a union to distance every wonder \n",
      "of the kind. -- The attachment of Frank Churchill and \n",
      "Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the \n",
      "comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , \n",
      "affording nothing to be said or thought. -- Mr . \n",
      "Knightley and Harriet Smith ! -- Such an elevation on \n",
      "her side ! Such a debasement on his ! It \n",
      "was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink \n",
      "him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles \n",
      ", the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at \n",
      "his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother \n",
      ", the thousand inconveniences to himself. -- Could it be \n",
      "? -- No ; it was impossible . And yet \n",
      "it was far , very far , from impossible. -- \n",
      "Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate \n",
      "abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ? Was \n",
      "it new for one , perhaps too busy to seek \n",
      ", to be the prize of a girl who would \n",
      "seek him ? -- Was it new for any thing \n",
      "in this world to be unequal , inconsistent , incongruous \n",
      "-- or for chance and circumstance ( as second causes \n",
      ") to direct the human fate ? Oh ! had \n",
      "she never brought Harriet forward ! Had she left her \n",
      "where she ought , and where he had told her \n",
      "she ought ! -- Had she not , with a \n",
      "folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying \n",
      "the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy \n",
      "and respectable in the line of life to which she \n",
      "ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; \n",
      "none of this dreadful sequel would have been . How \n",
      "Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her \n",
      "thoughts to Mr . Knightley ! -- How she could \n",
      "dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man \n",
      "till actually assured of it ! -- But Harriet was \n",
      "less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly. -- Her \n",
      "inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little \n",
      "felt. -- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton \n",
      "'s being to stoop in marrying her , than she \n",
      "now seemed of Mr . Knightley's. -- Alas ! was \n",
      "not that her own doing too ? Who had been \n",
      "at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself \n",

      "she was to elevate herself if possible , and that \n",
      "her claims were great to a high worldly establishment ? \n",
      "-- If Harriet , from being humble , were grown \n",
      "vain , it was her doing too . CHAPTER XII \n",
      "Till now that she was threatened with its loss , \n",
      "Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended \n",
      "on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley , first in interest \n",
      "and affection. -- Satisfied that it was so , and \n",
      "feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without \n",
      "reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted \n",
      ", found how inexpressibly important it had been. -- Long \n",
      ", very long , she felt she had been first \n",

      "herself been first with him for many years past . \n",
      "She had not deserved it ; she had often been \n",
      "negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even \n",
      "wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , \n",
      "and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her \n",
      "false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still \n",
      ", from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence \n",
      "of mind , he had loved her , and watched \n",
      "over her from a girl , with an endeavour to \n",
      "improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right \n",
      ", which no other creature had at all shared . \n",
      "In spite of all her faults , she knew she \n",

      "very dear ? -- When the suggestions of hope , \n",
      "however , which must follow here , presented themselves , \n",

      ". She could not flatter herself with any idea of \n",
      "blindness in his attachment to _her_ . She had received \n",
      "a very recent proof of its impartiality. -- How shocked \n",
      "had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! \n",
      "How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to \n",

      "the offence -- but far , far too strongly to \n",

      "goodwill. -- She had no hope , nothing to deserve \n",
      "the name of hope , that he could have that \n",
      "sort of affection for herself which was now in question \n",

      "slight one , at times much stronger , ) that \n",
      "Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his \n",
      "regard for _her_. -- Wish it she must , for \n",
      "his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , \n",
      "but his remaining single all his life . Could she \n",
      "be secure of that , indeed , of his never \n",

      "satisfied. -- Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley \n",
      "to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley \n",
      "to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose \n",
      "none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , \n",
      "and her peace would be fully secured. -- Marriage , \n",
      "in fact , would not do for her . It \n",
      "would be incompatible with what she owed to her father \n",
      ", and with what she felt for him . Nothing \n",
      "should separate her from her father . She would not \n",
      "marry , even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley \n",
      ". It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might \n",

      "admit that she could be blinded here. -- He was \n",
      "expected back every day . The power of observation would \n",
      "be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her \n",
      "thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , \n",
      "she resolved against seeing Harriet. -- It would do neither \n",
      "of them good , it would do the subject no \n",
      "good , to be talking of it farther. -- She \n",
      "was resolved not to be convinced , as long as \n",
      "she could doubt , and yet had no authority for \n",
      "opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only \n",
      "to irritate. -- She wrote to her , therefore , \n",
      "kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would \n",
      "not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging \n",
      "it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential \n",
      "discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and \n",
      "hoping , that if a few days were allowed to \n",
      "pass before they met again , except in the company \n",
      "of others -- she objected only to a tete-a-tete -- \n",
      "they might be able to act as if they had \n",
      "forgotten the conversation of yesterday. -- Harriet submitted , and \n",
      "approved , and was grateful . This point was just \n",
      "arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts \n",
      "a little from the one subject which had engrossed them \n",
      ", sleeping or waking , the last twenty-four hours -- \n",
      "Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter-in-law \n",
      "elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , \n",
      "almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure \n",
      "to herself , to relate all the particulars of so \n",
      "interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to \n",
      "Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of \n",
      "this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then \n",
      "induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , \n",
      "was now returned with much more to say , and \n",
      "much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter \n",
      "of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , \n",
      "with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have \n",
      "afforded . A little curiosity Emma had ; and she \n",
      "made the most of it while her friend related . \n",
      "Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in \n",
      "a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the \n",
      "first place had wished not to go at all at \n",
      "present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss \n",
      "Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till \n",
      "a little time had passed , and Mr. Churchill could \n",
      "be reconciled to the engagement 's becoming known ; as \n",
      ", considering every thing , she thought such a visit \n",
      "could not be paid without leading to reports : -- \n",
      "but Mr. Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely \n",
      "anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her \n",
      "family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could \n",
      "be excited by it ; or if it were , \n",
      "that it would be of any consequence ; for `` \n",
      "such things , '' he observed , '' always got \n",
      "about . '' Emma smiled , and felt that Mr. \n",
      "Weston had very good reason for saying so . They \n",
      "had gone , in short -- and very great had \n",
      "been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . \n",
      "She had hardly been able to speak a word , \n",
      "and every look and action had shewn how deeply she \n",
      "was suffering from consciousness . The quiet , heart-felt satisfaction \n",
      "of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of \n",
      "her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk \n",
      "as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost \n",
      "an affecting , scene . They were both so truly \n",
      "respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation \n",
      "; thought so much of Jane ; so much of \n",
      "every body , and so little of themselves , that \n",
      "every kindly feeling was at work for them . Miss \n",
      "Fairfax 's recent illness had offered a fair plea for \n",
      "Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing ; she \n",
      "had drawn back and declined at first , but , \n",
      "on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the \n",
      "course of their drive , Mrs. Weston had , by \n",
      "gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , \n",
      "as to bring her to converse on the important subject \n",
      ". Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first \n",
      "reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she \n",
      "was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston , must \n",
      "necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were \n",
      "put by , they had talked a good deal of \n",
      "the present and of the future state of the engagement \n",
      ". Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be \n",
      "the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within \n",
      "her own mind as every thing had so long been \n",
      ", and was very much pleased with all that she \n",
      "had said on the subject . `` On the misery \n",
      "of what she had suffered , during the concealment of \n",
      "so many months , '' continued Mrs. Weston , `` \n",
      "she was energetic . This was one of her expressions \n",
      ". ` I will not say , that since I \n",
      "entered into the engagement I have not had some happy \n",
      "moments ; but I can say , that I have \n",
      "never known the blessing of one tranquil hour : ' \n",
      "-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered \n",
      "it , was an attestation that I felt at my \n",
      "heart . '' `` Poor girl ! '' said Emma \n",
      ". `` She thinks herself wrong , then , for \n",
      "having consented to a private engagement ? '' `` Wrong \n",
      "! No one , I believe , can blame her \n",
      "more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` \n",
      "The consequence , ' said she , ` has been \n",
      "a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so \n",
      "it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct \n",
      "can bring , it is still not less misconduct . \n",
      "Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless \n",
      ". I have been acting contrary to all my sense \n",
      "of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing \n",
      "has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving \n",
      ", is what my conscience tells me ought not to \n",
      "be . ' ` Do not imagine , madam , \n",

      "or the care of the friends who brought me up \n",
      ". The error has been all my own ; and \n",
      "I do assure you that , with all the excuse \n",

      "to him . '' `` I am afraid , '' \n",

      "have contributed to make her unhappy . '' `` On \n",
      "your side , my love , it was very innocently \n",
      "done . But she probably had something of that in \n",
      "her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he \n",
      "had given us hints of before . One natural consequence \n",
      "of the evil she had involved herself in , '' \n",
      "she said , `` was that of making her _unreasonable_ \n",
      ". The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed \n",
      "her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious \n",

      ", under any other circumstances , would , I am \n",
      "sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , \n",
      "as they were at first . ' She then began \n",
      "to speak of you , and of the great kindness \n",
      "you had shewn her during her illness ; and with \n",
      "a blush which shewed me how it was all connected \n",

      "to thank you -- I could not thank you too \n",
      "much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do \n",

      "received any proper acknowledgment from herself . '' `` If \n",
      "I did not know her to be happy now , \n",
      "'' said Emma , seriously , '' which , in \n",
      "spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , \n",
      "she must be , I could not bear these thanks \n",
      "; -- for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if \n",
      "there were an account drawn up of the evil and \n",
      "the good I have done Miss Fairfax ! -- Well \n",
      "( checking herself , and trying to be more lively \n",

      "should be on his side , for I think the \n",
      "merit will be all on hers . '' Such a \n",
      "conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston . She \n",
      "thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and \n",
      ", what was more , she loved him very much \n",
      ", and her defence was , therefore , earnest . \n",
      "She talked with a great deal of reason , and \n",
      "at least equal affection -- but she had too much \n",
      "to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon \n",
      "gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot \n",
      "to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended \n",

      "by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense \n",
      "of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax . She bitterly regretted \n",
      "not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and \n",
      "blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , \n",

      "Mr. Knightley 's known wishes , in paying that attention \n",
      "to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due \n",
      "; had she tried to know her better ; had \n",
      "she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured \n",
      "to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith \n",
      "; she must , in all probability , have been \n",
      "spared from every pain which pressed on her now. -- \n",
      "Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally \n",
      "marking one as an associate for her , to be \n",
      "received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was \n",
      "she ? -- Supposing even that they had never become \n",
      "intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into \n",
      "Miss Fairfax 's confidence on this important matter -- which \n",
      "was most probable -- still , in knowing her as \n",
      "she ought , and as she might , she must \n",
      "have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper \n",
      "attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had not only \n",
      "so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so \n",
      "unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had \n",
      "been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy \n",
      "of Jane 's feelings , by the levity or carelessness \n",
      "of Frank Churchill 's . Of all the sources of \n",
      "evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury \n",
      ", she was persuaded that she must herself have been \n",
      "the worst . She must have been a perpetual enemy \n",
      ". They never could have been all three together , \n",
      "without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax 's peace in a \n",
      "thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , \n",
      "it had been the agony of a mind that would \n",
      "bear no more . The evening of this day was \n",
      "very long , and melancholy , at Hartfield . The \n",
      "weather added what it could of gloom . A cold \n",
      "stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared \n",
      "but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind \n",
      "was despoiling , and the length of the day , \n",
      "which only made such cruel sights the longer visible . \n",
      "The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse , and he could only \n",
      "be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his \n",
      "daughter 's side , and by exertions which had never \n",
      "cost her half so much before . It reminded her \n",
      "of their first forlorn tete-a-tete , on the evening of \n",
      "Mrs. Weston 's wedding-day ; but Mr. Knightley had walked \n",
      "in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every \n",
      "melancholy fancy . Alas ! such delightful proofs of Hartfield \n",
      "'s attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , \n",
      "might shortly be over . The picture which she had \n",
      "then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , \n",
      "had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , \n",
      "no pleasures had been lost. -- But her present forebodings \n",
      "she feared would experience no similar contradiction . The prospect \n",
      "before her now , was threatening to a degree that \n",
      "could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be \n",
      "even partially brightened . If all took place that might \n",
      "take place among the circle of her friends , Hartfield \n",
      "must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer \n",
      "her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness . \n",
      "The child to be born at Randalls must be a \n",
      "tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs. Weston \n",
      "'s heart and time would be occupied by it . \n",
      "They should lose her ; and , probably , in \n",
      "great measure , her husband also. -- Frank Churchill would \n",
      "return among them no more ; and Miss Fairfax , \n",
      "it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to \n",
      "belong to Highbury . They would be married , and \n",
      "settled either at or near Enscombe . All that were \n",
      "good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses \n",
      ", the loss of Donwell were to be added , \n",
      "what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within \n",
      "their reach ? Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming \n",
      "there for his evening comfort ! -- No longer walking \n",
      "in at all hours , as if ever willing to \n",
      "change his own home for their 's ! -- How \n",
      "was it to be endured ? And if he were \n",
      "to be lost to them for Harriet 's sake ; \n",
      "if he were to be thought of hereafter , as \n",
      "finding in Harriet 's society all that he wanted ; \n",
      "if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first \n",
      ", the dearest , the friend , the wife to \n",
      "whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence \n",
      "; what could be increasing Emma 's wretchedness but the \n",
      "reflection never far distant from her mind , that it \n",
      "had been all her own work ? When it came \n",
      "to such a pitch as this , she was not \n",
      "able to refrain from a start , or a heavy \n",
      "sigh , or even from walking about the room for \n",
      "a few seconds -- and the only source whence any \n",
      "thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was \n",
      "in the resolution of her own better conduct , and \n",
      "the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety \n",
      "might be the following and every future winter of her \n",
      "life to the past , it would yet find her \n",
      "more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave \n",
      "her less to regret when it were gone . CHAPTER \n",
      "XIII The weather continued much the same all the following \n",
      "morning ; and the same loneliness , and the same \n",
      "melancholy , seemed to reign at Hartfield -- but in \n",
      "the afternoon it cleared ; the wind changed into a \n",
      "softer quarter ; the clouds were carried off ; the \n",
      "sun appeared ; it was summer again . With all \n",
      "the eagerness which such a transition gives , Emma resolved \n",
      "to be out of doors as soon as possible . \n",
      "Never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of \n",
      "nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a \n",
      "storm , been more attractive to her . She longed \n",
      "for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on \n",
      "Mr. Perry 's coming in soon after dinner , with \n",
      "a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost \n",
      "no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery. -- There , \n",
      "with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , \n",
      "she had taken a few turns , when she saw \n",
      "Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming \n",
      "towards her. -- It was the first intimation of his \n",
      "being returned from London . She had been thinking of \n",
      "him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant. \n",
      "-- There was time only for the quickest arrangement of \n",
      "mind . She must be collected and calm . In \n",
      "half a minute they were together . The `` How \n",

      "and the first possible cause for it , suggested by \n",
      "her fears , was , that he had perhaps been \n",
      "communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained \n",
      "by the manner in which they had been received . \n",
      "They walked together . He was silent . She thought \n",
      "he was often looking at her , and trying for \n",
      "a fuller view of her face than it suited her \n",

      "trying to smile , began -- '' You have some \n",
      "news to hear , now you are come back , \n",
      "that will rather surprize you . '' `` Have I \n",

      "I seem to have been doomed to blindness . '' \n",
      "For a moment or two nothing was said , and \n",
      "she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , \n",
      "till she found her arm drawn within his , and \n",
      "pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying \n",

      "pressed again , as he added , in a more \n",
      "broken and subdued accent , `` The feelings of the \n",
      "warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel ! '' -- \n",
      "And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded \n",
      "with , `` He will soon be gone . They \n",
      "will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for \n",
      "_her_ . She deserves a better fate . '' Emma \n",
      "understood him ; and as soon as she could recover \n",
      "from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender \n",
      "consideration , replied , '' You are very kind -- \n",

      "`` are you , indeed ? '' -- but checking \n",
      "himself -- '' No , no , I understand you \n",
      "-- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can \n",

      "regret , indeed ! and it will not be very \n",
      "long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment \n",
      "of more than your reason. -- Fortunate that your affections \n",

      "comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see \n",
      "that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a \n",
      "mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as \n",
      "any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; \n",

      "-- And not only was there time for these convictions \n",
      ", with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there \n",
      "was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had \n",

      "reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal \n",
      "and degrading . Her way was clear , though not \n",
      "quite smooth. -- She spoke then , on being so \n",
      "entreated. -- What did she say ? -- Just what \n",
      "she ought , of course . A lady always does. \n",

      "-- The rest had been the work of the moment \n",

      "in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill \n",
      ", from about the same period , one sentiment having \n",
      "probably enlightened him as to the other . It was \n",
      "his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from \n",

      "again such permitted , encouraged attentions. -- He had gone \n",
      "to learn to be indifferent. -- But he had gone \n",
      "to a wrong place . There was too much domestic \n",

      ", vigorously , day after day -- till this very \n",
      "morning's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax. -- \n",
      "Then , with the gladness which must be felt , \n",

      "faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the \n",
      "discovery . He had found her agitated and low. -- \n",
      "Frank Churchill was a villain. -- He heard her declare \n",
      "that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill's character \n",
      "was not desperate. -- She was his own Emma , \n",
      "by hand and word , when they returned into the \n",
      "house ; and if he could have thought of Frank \n",
      "Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very \n",
      "good sort of fellow . CHAPTER XIV What totally different \n",
      "feelings did Emma take back into the house from what \n",
      "she had brought out ! -- she had then been \n",
      "only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering \n",
      "; -- she was now in an exquisite flutter of \n",
      "happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must \n",
      "still be greater when the flutter should have passed away \n",
      ". They sat down to tea -- the same party \n",
      "round the same table -- how often it had been \n",
      "collected ! -- and how often had her eyes fallen \n",
      "on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed \n",
      "the same beautiful effect of the western sun ! -- \n",
      "But never in such a state of spirits , never \n",
      "in any thing like it ; and it was with \n",
      "difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self \n",
      "to be the attentive lady of the house , or \n",
      "even the attentive daughter . Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected \n",
      "what was plotting against him in the breast of that \n",
      "man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so \n",
      "anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride. \n",
      "-- Could he have seen the heart , he would \n",
      "have cared very little for the lungs ; but without \n",
      "the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without \n",
      "the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks \n",
      "or ways of either , he repeated to them very \n",
      "comfortably all the articles of news he had received from \n",
      "Mr. Perry , and talked on with much self-contentment , \n",
      "totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in \n",
      "return . As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them \n",
      ", Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was \n",
      "gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and \n",
      "subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night \n",
      ", which was the tax for such an evening , \n",
      "she found one or two such very serious points to \n",
      "consider , as made her feel , that even her \n",
      "happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and \n",
      "Harriet . She could not be alone without feeling the \n",
      "full weight of their separate claims ; and how to \n",
      "guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was \n",
      "the question . With respect to her father , it \n",
      "was a question soon answered . She hardly knew yet \n",
      "what Mr. Knightley would ask ; but a very short \n",
      "parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution \n",
      "of never quitting her father. -- She even wept over \n",
      "the idea of it , as a sin of thought \n",
      ". While he lived , it must be only an \n",
      "engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested \n",
      "of the danger of drawing her away , it might \n",
      "become an increase of comfort to him. -- How to \n",
      "do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult \n",
      "decision ; -- how to spare her from any unnecessary \n",
      "pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; \n",
      "how to appear least her enemy ? -- On these \n",
      "subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great -- \n",
      "and her mind had to pass again and again through \n",
      "every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded \n",
      "it. -- She could only resolve at last , that \n",
      "she would still avoid a meeting with her , and \n",
      "communicate all that need be told by letter ; that \n",
      "it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just \n",
      "now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging \n",
      "in one scheme more -- nearly resolve , that it \n",
      "might be practicable to get an invitation for her to \n",
      "Brunswick Square. -- Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; \n",
      "and a few weeks spent in London must give her \n",
      "some amusement. -- She did not think it in Harriet \n",
      "'s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety \n",
      ", by the streets , the shops , and the \n",
      "children. -- At any rate , it would be a \n",
      "proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom \n",
      "every thing was due ; a separation for the present \n",
      "; an averting of the evil day , when they \n",
      "must all be together again . She rose early , \n",
      "and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which \n",
      "left her so very serious , so nearly sad , \n",
      "that Mr. Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to \n",
      "breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; \n",
      "and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the \n",
      "same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , \n",
      "was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share \n",
      "of the happiness of the evening before . He had \n",
      "not left her long , by no means long enough \n",
      "for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of \n",
      "any body else , when a letter was brought her \n",
      "from Randalls -- a very thick letter ; -- she \n",
      "guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity \n",
      "of reading it. -- She was now in perfect charity \n",
      "with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she \n",
      "wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and \n",
      "as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was \n",
      "sure she was incapable of it. -- It must be \n",
      "waded through , however . She opened the packet ; \n",
      "it was too surely so ; -- a note from \n",
      "Mrs. Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from \n",
      "Frank to Mrs. Weston . `` I have the greatest \n",
      "pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you \n",
      "the enclosed . I know what thorough justice you will \n",
      "do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its \n",
      "happy effect. -- I think we shall never materially disagree \n",
      "about the writer again ; but I will not delay \n",
      "you by a long preface. -- We are quite well. \n",
      "-- This letter has been the cure of all the \n",
      "little nervousness I have been feeling lately. -- I did \n",
      "not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it \n",
      "was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never \n",
      "own being affected by weather , I think every body \n",
      "feels a north-east wind. -- I felt for your dear \n",
      "father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and \n",
      "yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last \n",
      "night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not \n",
      "made him ill. `` Yours ever , `` A. W. \n",

      "MY DEAR MADAM , '' If I made myself intelligible \n",
      "yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected \n",
      "or not , I know it will be read with \n",
      "candour and indulgence. -- You are all goodness , and \n",
      "I believe there will be need of even all your \n",
      "goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct. \n",
      "-- But I have been forgiven by one who had \n",
      "still more to resent . My courage rises while I \n",
      "write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to \n",
      "be humble . I have already met with such success \n",
      "in two applications for pardon , that I may be \n",
      "in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , \n",
      "and of those among your friends who have had any \n",
      "ground of offence. -- You must all endeavour to comprehend \n",
      "the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived \n",
      "at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a \n",
      "secret which was to be kept at all hazards . \n",
      "This was the fact . My right to place myself \n",
      "in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question \n",
      ". I shall not discuss it here . For my \n",
      "temptation to _think_ it a right , I refer every \n",
      "caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , \n",
      "and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not \n",
      "address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state \n",
      "of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition \n",
      "; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before \n",
      "we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most \n",
      "upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity \n",
      "to a secret engagement. -- Had she refused , I \n",
      "should have gone mad. -- But you will be ready \n",
      "to say , what was your hope in doing this \n",
      "? -- What did you look forward to ? -- \n",
      "To any thing , every thing -- to time , \n",
      "chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , \n",
      "perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility \n",
      "of good was before me , and the first of \n",
      "blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and \n",
      "correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have \n",
      "the honour , my dear madam , of being your \n",
      "husband 's son , and the advantage of inheriting a \n",
      "disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of \n",
      "houses or lands can ever equal the value of. -- \n",
      "See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving \n",
      "on my first visit to Randalls ; -- and here \n",
      "I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might \n",
      "have been sooner paid . You will look back and \n",
      "see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was \n",
      "in Highbury ; and as _you_ were the person slighted \n",
      ", you will forgive me instantly ; but I must \n",
      "work on my father 's compassion , by reminding him \n",
      ", that so long as I absented myself from his \n",
      "house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing \n",
      "you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight \n",
      "which I spent with you , did not , I \n",
      "hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on \n",
      "one point . And now I come to the principal \n",
      ", the only important part of my conduct while belonging \n",
      "to you , which excites my own anxiety , or \n",
      "requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , \n",
      "and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse \n",
      "; my father perhaps will think I ought to add \n",
      ", with the deepest humiliation. -- A few words which \n",
      "dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some \n",
      "censure I acknowledge myself liable to. -- My behaviour to \n",
      "Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it \n",
      "ought. -- In order to assist a concealment so essential \n",
      "to me , I was led on to make more \n",
      "than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into \n",
      "which we were immediately thrown. -- I can not deny \n",
      "that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I \n",
      "am sure you will believe the declaration , that had \n",
      "I not been convinced of her indifference , I would \n",
      "not have been induced by any selfish views to go \n",
      "on. -- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , \n",
      "she never gave me the idea of a young woman \n",
      "likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly \n",
      "free from any tendency to being attached to me , \n",
      "was as much my conviction as my wish. -- She \n",
      "received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured \n",
      "playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to \n",
      "understand each other . From our relative situation , those \n",
      "attentions were her due , and were felt to be \n",
      "so. -- Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me \n",
      "before the expiration of that fortnight , I can not \n",
      "say ; -- when I called to take leave of \n",
      "her , I remember that I was within a moment \n",
      "of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she \n",
      "was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt \n",
      "of her having since detected me , at least in \n",
      "some degree. -- She may not have surmised the whole \n",
      ", but her quickness must have penetrated a part . \n",
      "I can not doubt it . You will find , \n",
      "whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , \n",
      "that it did not take her wholly by surprize . \n",
      "She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember \n",
      "her telling me at the ball , that I owed \n",
      "Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax. -- \n",
      "I hope this history of my conduct towards her will \n",
      "be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation \n",
      "of what you saw amiss . While you considered me \n",
      "as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve \n",
      "nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure \n",
      "for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal \n",
      "and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom \n",
      "I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to \n",
      "long to have her as deeply and as happily in \n",
      "love as myself. -- Whatever strange things I said or \n",
      "did during that fortnight , you have now a key \n",
      "to . My heart was in Highbury , and my \n",
      "business was to get my body thither as often as \n",
      "might be , and with the least suspicion . If \n",
      "you remember any queernesses , set them all to the \n",
      "right account. -- Of the pianoforte so much talked of \n",
      ", I feel it only necessary to say , that \n",
      "its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F -- \n",
      ", who would never have allowed me to send it \n",
      ", had any choice been given her. -- The delicacy \n",
      "of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear \n",
      "madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice \n",
      "to . You will soon , I earnestly hope , \n",
      "know her thoroughly yourself. -- No description can describe her \n",
      ". She must tell you herself what she is -- \n",
      "yet not by word , for never was there a \n",
      "human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit. \n",
      "-- Since I began this letter , which will be \n",
      "longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her. \n",
      "-- She gives a good account of her own health \n",
      "; but as she never complains , I dare not \n",
      "depend . I want to have your opinion of her \n",
      "looks . I know you will soon call on her \n",
      "; she is living in dread of the visit . \n",
      "Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from \n",
      "you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand \n",
      "particulars . Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls \n",
      ", and in how bewildered , how mad a state \n",
      ": and I am not much better yet ; still \n",
      "insane either from happiness or misery . When I think \n",
      "of the kindness and favour I have met with , \n",
      "of her excellence and patience , and my uncle 's \n",
      "generosity , I am mad with joy : but when \n",
      "I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and \n",
      "how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am \n",
      "mad with anger . If I could but see her \n",
      "again ! -- But I must not propose it yet \n",
      ". My uncle has been too good for me to \n",
      "encroach. -- I must still add to this long letter \n",
      ". You have not heard all that you ought to \n",
      "hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday \n",
      "; but the suddenness , and , in one light \n",
      ", the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , \n",
      "needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th \n",
      "ult. , as you will conclude , immediately opened to \n",
      "me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed \n",
      "on such early measures , but from the very particular \n",
      "circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose \n",
      ". I should myself have shrunk from any thing so \n",
      "hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of \n",
      "mine with multiplied strength and refinement. -- But I had \n",
      "no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into \n",
      "with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , \n",
      "I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect \n",
      "and compose myself. -- I have been walking over the \n",
      "country , and am now , I hope , rational \n",
      "enough to make the rest of my letter what it \n",
      "ought to be. -- It is , in fact , \n",
      "a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully \n",
      ". And here I can admit , that my manners \n",
      "to Miss W. , in being unpleasant to Miss F. \n",
      ", were highly blameable . _She_ disapproved them , which \n",
      "ought to have been enough. -- My plea of concealing \n",
      "the truth she did not think sufficient. -- She was \n",
      "displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her \n",
      ", on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious \n",
      ": I thought her even cold . But she was \n",
      "always right . If I had followed her judgment , \n",
      "and subdued my spirits to the level of what she \n",
      "deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness \n",
      "I have ever known. -- We quarrelled. -- Do you \n",
      "remember the morning spent at Donwell ? -- _There_ every \n",
      "little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis \n",
      ". I was late ; I met her walking home \n",
      "by herself , and wanted to walk with her , \n",
      "but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused \n",
      "to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable \n",
      ". Now , however , I see nothing in it \n",
      "but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . \n",
      "While I , to blind the world to our engagement \n",
      ", was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another \n",
      "woman , was she to be consenting the next to \n",
      "a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless \n",
      "? -- Had we been met walking together between Donwell \n",
      "and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected. -- \n",
      "I was mad enough , however , to resent. -- \n",
      "I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the \n",
      "next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by \n",
      "such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent \n",
      "neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss \n",
      "W. , as it would have been impossible for any \n",
      "woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment \n",
      "in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me. -- \n",
      "In short , my dear madam , it was a \n",
      "quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; \n",
      "and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though \n",
      "I might have staid with you till the next morning \n",
      ", merely because I would be as angry with her \n",
      "as possible . Even then , I was not such \n",
      "a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in \n",
      "time ; but I was the injured person , injured \n",
      "by her coldness , and I went away determined that \n",
      "she should make the first advances. -- I shall always \n",
      "congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill \n",
      "party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I \n",
      "can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of \n",
      "me again . Its effect upon her appears in the \n",
      "immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found \n",
      "I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with \n",
      "the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole \n",
      "system of whose treatment of her , by the bye \n",
      ", has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . \n",
      "I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which \n",
      "has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , \n",
      "otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of \n",
      "it which that woman has known. -- ` Jane , \n",
      "' indeed ! -- You will observe that I have \n",
      "not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name \n",
      ", even to you . Think , then , what \n",
      "I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the \n",
      "Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and \n",
      "all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with \n",
      "me , I shall soon have done. -- She closed \n",
      "with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely \n",
      ", and wrote the next day to tell me that \n",
      "we never were to meet again. -- _She_ _felt_ _the_ \n",
      "_engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ \n",
      "_each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_. -- This letter reached me \n",
      "on the very morning of my poor aunt 's death \n",
      ". I answered it within an hour ; but from \n",
      "the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of \n",
      "business falling on me at once , my answer , \n",
      "instead of being sent with all the many other letters \n",
      "of that day , was locked up in my writing-desk \n",
      "; and I , trusting that I had written enough \n",
      ", though but a few lines , to satisfy her \n",
      ", remained without any uneasiness. -- I was rather disappointed \n",
      "that I did not hear from her again speedily ; \n",
      "but I made excuses for her , and was too \n",
      "busy , and -- may I add ? -- too \n",
      "cheerful in my views to be captious. -- We removed \n",
      "to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a \n",
      "parcel from her , my own letters all returned ! \n",
      "-- and a few lines at the same time by \n",
      "the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having \n",
      "had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding \n",
      ", that as silence on such a point could not \n",
      "be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable \n",
      "to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon \n",

      "to Emma 's feelings . She was obliged , in \n",
      "spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to \n",
      "do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold . \n",
      "As soon as she came to her own name , \n",
      "it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was \n",
      "interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when \n",
      "this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself \n",
      ", by the natural return of her former regard for \n",
      "the writer , and the very strong attraction which any \n",
      "picture of love must have for her at that moment \n",
      ". She never stopt till she had gone through the \n",
      "whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel \n",
      "that he had been wrong , yet he had been \n",
      "less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had \n",
      "suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was \n",
      "so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in \n",
      "love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy \n",
      "herself , that there was no being severe ; and \n",
      "could he have entered the room , she must have \n",
      "shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . She \n",
      "thought so well of the letter , that when Mr. \n",
      "Knightley came again , she desired him to read it \n",
      ". She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it \n",
      "to be communicated ; especially to one , who , \n",
      "like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame \n",
      "in his conduct . `` I shall be very glad \n",
      "to look it over , '' said he ; `` \n",
      "but it seems long . I will take it home \n",
      "with me at night . '' But that would not \n",
      "do . Mr. Weston was to call in the evening \n",
      ", and she must return it by him . `` \n",
      "I would rather be talking to you , '' he \n",
      "replied ; `` but as it seems a matter of \n",
      "justice , it shall be done . '' He began \n",
      "-- stopping , however , almost directly to say , \n",
      "`` Had I been offered the sight of one of \n",
      "this gentleman 's letters to his mother-in-law a few months \n",
      "ago , Emma , it would not have been taken \n",
      "with such indifference . '' He proceeded a little farther \n",
      ", reading to himself ; and then , with a \n",
      "smile , observed , `` Humph ! a fine complimentary \n",
      "opening : But it is his way . One man \n",
      "'s style must not be the rule of another 's \n",
      ". We will not be severe . '' `` It \n",
      "will be natural for me , '' he added shortly \n",
      "afterwards , `` to speak my opinion aloud as I \n",
      "read . By doing it , I shall feel that \n",
      "I am near you . It will not be so \n",
      "great a loss of time : but if you dislike \n",
      "it -- '' '' Not at all . I should \n",
      "wish it . '' Mr. Knightley returned to his reading \n",
      "with greater alacrity . `` He trifles here , '' \n",
      "said he , `` as to the temptation . He \n",
      "knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to \n",
      "urge. -- Bad. -- He ought not to have formed \n",
      "the engagement. -- ` His father 's disposition : ' \n",
      "-- he is unjust , however , to his father \n",
      ". Mr. Weston 's sanguine temper was a blessing on \n",
      "all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr. Weston \n",
      "earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it. \n",
      "-- Very true ; he did not come till Miss \n",
      "Fairfax was here . '' `` And I have not \n",
      "forgotten , '' said Emma , `` how sure you \n",
      "were that he might have come sooner if he would \n",
      ". You pass it over very handsomely -- but you \n",
      "were perfectly right . '' `` I was not quite \n",
      "impartial in my judgment , Emma : -- but yet \n",
      ", I think -- had _you_ not been in the \n",
      "case -- I should still have distrusted him . '' \n",
      "When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged \n",
      "to read the whole of it aloud -- all that \n",
      "related to her , with a smile ; a look \n",
      "; a shake of the head ; a word or \n",
      "two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of \n",
      "love , as the subject required ; concluding , however \n",
      ", seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus \n",
      "-- '' Very bad -- though it might have been \n",
      "worse. -- Playing a most dangerous game . Too much \n",
      "indebted to the event for his acquittal. -- No judge \n",
      "of his own manners by you. -- Always deceived in \n",
      "fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little \n",
      "besides his own convenience. -- Fancying you to have fathomed \n",
      "his secret . Natural enough ! -- his own mind \n",
      "full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in \n",
      "others. -- Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the \n",
      "understanding ! My Emma , does not every thing serve \n",
      "to prove more and more the beauty of truth and \n",
      "sincerity in all our dealings with each other ? '' \n",
      "Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of \n",
      "sensibility on Harriet 's account , which she could not \n",
      "give any sincere explanation of . `` You had better \n",
      "go on , '' said she . He did so \n",
      ", but very soon stopt again to say , `` \n",
      "the pianoforte ! Ah ! That was the act of \n",
      "a very , very young man , one too young \n",
      "to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very \n",
      "much exceed the pleasure . A boyish scheme , indeed \n",
      "! -- I can not comprehend a man 's wishing \n",
      "to give a woman any proof of affection which he \n",
      "knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did \n",
      "know that she would have prevented the instrument 's coming \n",
      "if she could . '' After this , he made \n",
      "some progress without any pause . Frank Churchill 's confession \n",
      "of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call \n",
      "for more than a word in passing . `` I \n",
      "perfectly agree with you , sir , '' -- was \n",
      "then his remark . `` You did behave very shamefully \n",
      ". You never wrote a truer line . '' And \n",
      "having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of \n",
      "their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct \n",
      "opposition to Jane Fairfax 's sense of right , he \n",
      "made a fuller pause to say , `` This is \n",
      "very bad. -- He had induced her to place herself \n",
      ", for his sake , in a situation of extreme \n",
      "difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his \n",
      "first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily. -- She \n",
      "must have had much more to contend with , in \n",
      "carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He \n",
      "should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been \n",
      "such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must \n",
      "look to her one fault , and remember that she \n",
      "had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement \n",
      ", to bear that she should have been in such \n",
      "a state of punishment . '' Emma knew that he \n",
      "was now getting to the Box Hill party , and \n",
      "grew uncomfortable . Her own behaviour had been so very \n",
      "improper ! She was deeply ashamed , and a little \n",
      "afraid of his next look . It was all read \n",
      ", however , steadily , attentively , and without the \n",
      "smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at \n",
      "her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving \n",
      "pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist \n",
      ". `` There is no saying much for the delicacy \n",
      "of our good friends , the Eltons , '' was \n",
      "his next observation. -- '' His feelings are natural. -- \n",
      "What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely ! \n",
      "-- She felt the engagement to be a source of \n",
      "repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it. -- \n",
      "What a view this gives of her sense of his \n",
      "behaviour ! -- Well , he must be a most \n",
      "extraordinary -- '' '' Nay , nay , read on. \n",
      "-- You will find how very much he suffers . \n",
      "'' `` I hope he does , '' replied Mr. \n",
      "Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . `` ` \n",
      "Smallridge ! ' -- What does this mean ? What \n",
      "is all this ? '' `` She had engaged to \n",
      "go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children -- a \n",

      "me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . \n",
      "Only one page more . I shall soon have done \n",
      ". What a letter the man writes ! '' `` \n",
      "I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit \n",
      "towards him . '' `` Well , there _is_ feeling \n",
      "here. -- He does seem to have suffered in finding \n",

      "satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still \n",
      "you must , at least I hope you must , \n",
      "think the better of him for it . I hope \n",
      "it does him some service with you . '' `` \n",
      "Yes , certainly it does . He has had great \n",
      "faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I \n",
      "am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely \n",
      "to be happier than he deserves : but still as \n",
      "he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be \n",
      "hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her \n",
      ", I am very ready to believe his character will \n",

      "another person 's interest at present so much at heart \n",
      ", that I can not think any longer about Frank \n",
      "Churchill . Ever since I left you this morning , \n",
      "Emma , my mind has been hard at work on \n",
      "one subject . '' The subject followed ; it was \n",
      "in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as \n",
      "Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in \n",
      "love with , how to be able to ask her \n",
      "to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her \n",
      "father . Emma 's answer was ready at the first \n",
      "word . `` While her dear father lived , any \n",
      "change of condition must be impossible for her . She \n",
      "could never quit him . '' Part only of this \n",
      "answer , however , was admitted . The impossibility of \n",
      "her quitting her father , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly \n",
      "as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change \n",
      ", he could not agree to . He had been \n",
      "thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he \n",
      "had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove \n",
      "with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe \n",
      "it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would \n",
      "not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now \n",
      "he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would \n",
      "be a risk of her father 's comfort , perhaps \n",
      "even of his life , which must not be hazarded \n",
      ". Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield ! -- No , \n",
      "he felt that it ought not to be attempted . \n",
      "But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of \n",
      "this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find \n",
      "in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he \n",
      "should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as \n",
      "her father 's happiness in other words his life -- \n",
      "required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be \n",
      "his likewise . Of their all removing to Donwell , \n",
      "Emma had already had her own passing thoughts . Like \n",
      "him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it \n",
      "; but such an alternative as this had not occurred \n",
      "to her . She was sensible of all the affection \n",
      "it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell \n",
      ", he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence \n",
      "of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with \n",
      "her father , and in no house of his own \n",
      ", there would be much , very much , to \n",
      "be borne with . She promised to think of it \n",
      ", and advised him to think of it more ; \n",
      "but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could \n",
      "alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . \n",
      "He had given it , he could assure her , \n",
      "very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking \n",
      "away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have \n",
      "his thoughts to himself . `` Ah ! there is \n",
      "one difficulty unprovided for , '' cried Emma . `` \n",
      "I am sure William Larkins will not like it . \n",
      "You must get his consent before you ask mine . \n",
      "'' She promised , however , to think of it \n",
      "; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think \n",
      "of it , with the intention of finding it a \n",
      "very good scheme . It is remarkable , that Emma \n",
      ", in the many , very many , points of \n",
      "view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell \n",
      "Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury \n",
      "to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir-expectant had \n",
      "formerly been so tenaciously regarded . Think she must of \n",
      "the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and \n",
      "yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about \n",
      "it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause \n",
      "of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane \n",
      "Fairfax , or any body else , which at the \n",
      "time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of \n",
      "the sister and the aunt . This proposal of his \n",
      ", this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield -- \n",
      "the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it \n",
      "became . His evils seemed to lessen , her own \n",
      "advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every \n",
      "drawback . Such a companion for herself in the periods \n",
      "of anxiety and cheerlessness before her ! -- Such a \n",
      "partner in all those duties and cares to which time \n",
      "must be giving increase of melancholy ! She would have \n",
      "been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every \n",
      "blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the \n",
      "sufferings of her friend , who must now be even \n",
      "excluded from Hartfield . The delightful family party which Emma \n",
      "was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in \n",
      "mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from \n",
      ". She would be a loser in every way . \n",
      "Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction \n",
      "from her own enjoyment . In such a party , \n",
      "Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; \n",
      "but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a \n",
      "peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in \n",
      "such a state of unmerited punishment . In time , \n",
      "of course , Mr. Knightley would be forgotten , that \n",
      "is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected \n",
      "to happen very early . Mr. Knightley himself would be \n",
      "doing nothing to assist the cure ; -- not like \n",
      "Mr. Elton . Mr. Knightley , always so kind , \n",
      "so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , \n",
      "would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; \n",
      "and it really was too much to hope even of \n",
      "Harriet , that she could be in love with more \n",
      "than _three_ men in one year . CHAPTER XVI It \n",
      "was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet \n",
      "as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . Their \n",
      "intercourse was painful enough by letter . How much worse \n",
      ", had they been obliged to meet ! Harriet expressed \n",
      "herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches \n",
      ", or apparent sense of ill-usage ; and yet Emma \n",
      "fancied there was a something of resentment , a something \n",
      "bordering on it in her style , which increased the \n",
      "desirableness of their being separate. -- It might be only \n",
      "her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an \n",
      "angel only could have been quite without resentment under such \n",
      "a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella \n",
      "'s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a \n",
      "sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention. \n",
      "-- There was a tooth amiss . Harriet really wished \n",
      ", and had wished some time , to consult a \n",
      "dentist . Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of \n",
      "use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation \n",
      "to her -- and though not so fond of a \n",
      "dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite \n",
      "eager to have Harriet under her care. -- When it \n",
      "was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma \n",
      "proposed it to her friend , and found her very \n",
      "persuadable. -- Harriet was to go ; she was invited \n",
      "for at least a fortnight ; she was to be \n",
      "conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage. -- It was all \n",
      "arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was \n",
      "safe in Brunswick Square . Now Emma could , indeed \n",
      ", enjoy Mr. Knightley 's visits ; now she could \n",
      "talk , and she could listen with true happiness , \n",
      "unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , \n",
      "of something most painful , which had haunted her when \n",
      "remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how \n",
      "much might at that moment , and at a little \n",
      "distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had \n",
      "led astray herself . The difference of Harriet at Mrs. \n",
      "Goddard 's , or in London , made perhaps an \n",

      "but it was too tender a subject. -- She could \n",
      "not enter on it. -- Harriet was very seldom mentioned \n",
      "between them . This , on his side , might \n",
      "merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but \n",
      "Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , \n",
      "and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their \n",
      "friendship were declining . She was aware herself , that \n",
      ", parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should \n",
      "have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not \n",
      "have rested , as it now almost wholly did , \n",
      "on Isabella 's letters . He might observe that it \n",
      "was so . The pain of being obliged to practise \n",
      "concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the \n",
      "pain of having made Harriet unhappy . Isabella sent quite \n",
      "as good an account of her visitor as could be \n",
      "expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her \n",
      "out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as \n",
      "there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , \n",
      "since that business had been over , she did not \n",
      "appear to find Harriet different from what she had known \n",
      "her before. -- Isabella , to be sure , was \n",
      "no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not \n",
      "been equal to playing with the children , it would \n",
      "not have escaped her . Emma 's comforts and hopes \n",
      "were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet 's being \n",
      "to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be \n",
      "a month at least . Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley \n",
      "were to come down in August , and she was \n",
      "invited to remain till they could bring her back . \n",
      "`` John does not even mention your friend , '' \n",
      "said Mr. Knightley . `` Here is his answer , \n",
      "if you like to see it . '' It was \n",
      "the answer to the communication of his intended marriage . \n",
      "Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with \n",
      "an impatience all alive to know what he would say \n",
      "about it , and not at all checked by hearing \n",
      "that her friend was unmentioned . `` John enters like \n",
      "a brother into my happiness , '' continued Mr. Knightley \n",

      ". He seems perfectly unprepared for that . '' `` \n",
      "Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he \n",
      "should have seen so far into my feelings . What \n",
      "has he been judging by ? -- I am not \n",
      "conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that \n",
      "could prepare him at this time for my marrying any \n",
      "more than at another. -- But it was so , \n",
      "I suppose . I dare say there was a difference \n",
      "when I was staying with them the other day . \n",
      "I believe I did not play with the children quite \n",

      "? -- I can hardly imagine that any thing which \n",
      "pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse \n",
      "me too . '' `` There is one subject , \n",
      "'' he replied , `` I hope but one , \n",
      "on which we do not think alike . '' He \n",
      "paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes \n",
      "fixed on her face . `` Does nothing occur to \n",
      "you ? -- Do not you recollect ? -- Harriet \n",
      "Smith . '' Her cheeks flushed at the name , \n",
      "and she felt afraid of something , though she knew \n",
      "not what . `` Have you heard from her yourself \n",
      "this morning ? '' cried he . `` You have \n",
      ", I believe , and know the whole . '' \n",
      "`` No , I have not ; I know nothing \n",
      "; pray tell me . '' `` You are prepared \n",
      "for the worst , I see -- and very bad \n",
      "it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . '' \n",
      "Emma gave a start , which did not seem like \n",
      "being prepared -- and her eyes , in eager gaze \n",
      ", said , `` No , this is impossible ! \n",
      "'' but her lips were closed . `` It is \n",
      "so , indeed , '' continued Mr. Knightley ; `` \n",
      "I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left \n",
      "me not half an hour ago . '' She was \n",
      "still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . \n",
      "`` You like it , my Emma , as little \n",
      "as I feared. -- I wish our opinions were the \n",
      "same . But in time they will . Time , \n",
      "you may be sure , will make one or the \n",
      "other of us think differently ; and , in the \n",
      "meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject \n",
      ". '' `` You mistake me , you quite mistake \n",
      "me , '' she replied , exerting herself . `` \n",
      "It is not that such a circumstance would now make \n",
      "me unhappy , but I can not believe it . \n",
      "It seems an impossibility ! -- You can not mean \n",
      "to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin \n",
      ". You can not mean that he has even proposed \n",
      "to her again -- yet . You only mean , \n",
      "that he intends it . '' `` I mean that \n",
      "he has done it , '' answered Mr. Knightley , \n",
      "with smiling but determined decision , `` and been accepted \n",
      ". '' `` Good God ! '' she cried. -- \n",
      "'' Well ! '' -- Then having recourse to her \n",
      "workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , \n",
      "and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment \n",
      "which she knew she must be expressing , she added \n",
      ", `` Well , now tell me every thing ; \n",
      "make this intelligible to me . How , where , \n",
      "when ? -- Let me know it all . I \n",
      "never was more surprized -- but it does not make \n",
      "me unhappy , I assure you. -- How -- how \n",
      "has it been possible ? '' `` It is a \n",
      "very simple story . He went to town on business \n",
      "three days ago , and I got him to take \n",
      "charge of some papers which I was wanting to send \n",
      "to John. -- He delivered these papers to John , \n",
      "at his chambers , and was asked by him to \n",
      "join their party the same evening to Astley 's . \n",
      "They were going to take the two eldest boys to \n",
      "Astley 's . The party was to be our brother \n",
      "and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith \n",
      ". My friend Robert could not resist . They called \n",
      "for him in their way ; were all extremely amused \n",
      "; and my brother asked him to dine with them \n",
      "the next day -- which he did -- and in \n",
      "the course of that visit ( as I understand ) \n",
      "he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and \n",
      "certainly did not speak in vain. -- She made him \n",
      ", by her acceptance , as happy even as he \n",
      "is deserving . He came down by yesterday 's coach \n",
      ", and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast \n",
      ", to report his proceedings , first on my affairs \n",
      ", and then on his own . This is all \n",
      "that I can relate of the how , where , \n",
      "and when . Your friend Harriet will make a much \n",
      "longer history when you see her. -- She will give \n",
      "you all the minute particulars , which only woman's language \n",
      "can make interesting. -- In our communications we deal only \n",
      "in the great. -- However , I must say , \n",
      "that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _him_ , and \n",
      "to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did \n",
      "mention , without its being much to the purpose , \n",
      "that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my \n",
      "brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John \n",
      ", and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; \n",
      "and that at one time they were in such a \n",
      "crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy . \n",
      "'' He stopped. -- Emma dared not attempt any immediate \n",
      "reply . To speak , she was sure would be \n",
      "to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . She \n",
      "must wait a moment , or he would think her \n",
      "mad . Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing \n",
      "her a little while , he added , '' Emma \n",
      ", my love , you said that this circumstance would \n",
      "not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid \n",
      "it gives you more pain than you expected . His \n",
      "situation is an evil -- but you must consider it \n",
      "as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer \n",
      "for your thinking better and better of him as you \n",
      "know him more . His good sense and good principles \n",
      "would delight you. -- As far as the man is \n",
      "concerned , you could not wish your friend in better \n",
      "hands . His rank in society I would alter if \n",
      "I could , which is saying a great deal I \n",
      "assure you , Emma. -- You laugh at me about \n",
      "William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare \n",
      "Robert Martin . '' He wanted her to look up \n",
      "and smile ; and having now brought herself not to \n",
      "smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering , \n",
      "'' You need not be at any pains to reconcile \n",
      "me to the match . I think Harriet is doing \n",
      "extremely well . _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ \n",
      ". In respectability of character , there can be no \n",
      "doubt that they are . I have been silent from \n",
      "surprize merely , excessive surprize . You can not imagine \n",
      "how suddenly it has come on me ! how peculiarly \n",
      "unprepared I was ! -- for I had reason to \n",
      "believe her very lately more determined against him , much \n",
      "more , than she was before . '' `` You \n",
      "ought to know your friend best , '' replied Mr. \n",
      "Knightley ; '' but I should say she was a \n",
      "good-tempered , soft-hearted girl , not likely to be very \n",
      ", very determined against any young man who told her \n",
      "he loved her . '' Emma could not help laughing \n",
      "as she answered , `` Upon my word , I \n",
      "believe you know her quite as well as I do. \n",
      "-- But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure \n",
      "that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him . I \n",
      "could suppose she might in time -- but can she \n",
      "already ? -- Did not you misunderstand him ? -- \n",
      "You were both talking of other things ; of business \n",
      ", shows of cattle , or new drills -- and \n",
      "might not you , in the confusion of so many \n",
      "subjects , mistake him ? -- It was not Harriet \n",
      "'s hand that he was certain of -- it was \n",
      "the dimensions of some famous ox . '' The contrast \n",
      "between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert \n",
      "Martin was , at this moment , so strong to \n",
      "Emma 's feelings , and so strong was the recollection \n",
      "of all that had so recently passed on Harriet 's \n",
      "side , so fresh the sound of those words , \n",
      "spoken with such emphasis , `` No , I hope \n",
      "I know better than to think of Robert Martin , \n",
      "'' that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove \n",
      ", in some measure , premature . It could not \n",
      "be otherwise . `` Do you dare say this ? \n",
      "'' cried Mr. Knightley . `` Do you dare to \n",
      "suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to \n",
      "know what a man is talking of ? -- What \n",
      "do you deserve ? '' `` Oh ! I always \n",
      "deserve the best treatment , because I never put up \n",
      "with any other ; and , therefore , you must \n",
      "give me a plain , direct answer . Are you \n",
      "quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. \n",
      "Martin and Harriet now are ? '' `` I am \n",
      "quite sure , '' he replied , speaking very distinctly \n",
      ", `` that he told me she had accepted him \n",
      "; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful \n",
      ", in the words he used ; and I think \n",
      "I can give you a proof that it must be \n",
      "so . He asked my opinion as to what he \n",
      "was now to do . He knew of no one \n",
      "but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information \n",
      "of her relations or friends . Could I mention any \n",
      "thing more fit to be done , than to go \n",
      "to Mrs. Goddard ? I assured him that I could \n",
      "not . Then , he said , he would endeavour \n",
      "to see her in the course of this day . \n",
      "'' `` I am perfectly satisfied , '' replied Emma \n",
      ", with the brightest smiles , '' and most sincerely \n",
      "wish them happy . '' `` You are materially changed \n",
      "since we talked on this subject before . '' `` \n",
      "I hope so -- for at that time I was \n",
      "a fool . '' `` And I am changed also \n",
      "; for I am now very willing to grant you \n",
      "all Harriet 's good qualities . I have taken some \n",
      "pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's \n",
      "sake , ( whom I have always had reason to \n",
      "believe as much in love with her as ever , \n",
      ") to get acquainted with her . I have often \n",
      "talked to her a good deal . You must have \n",
      "seen that I did . Sometimes , indeed , I \n",
      "have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor \n",
      "Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; \n",
      "but , from all my observations , I am convinced \n",
      "of her being an artless , amiable girl , with \n",
      "very good notions , very seriously good principles , and \n",
      "placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic \n",
      "life. -- Much of this , I have no doubt \n",
      ", she may thank you for . '' `` Me \n",
      "! '' cried Emma , shaking her head. -- '' \n",
      "Ah ! poor Harriet ! '' She checked herself , \n",
      "however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise \n",
      "than she deserved . Their conversation was soon afterwards closed \n",
      "by the entrance of her father . She was not \n",
      "sorry . She wanted to be alone . Her mind \n",
      "was in a state of flutter and wonder , which \n",
      "made it impossible for her to be collected . She \n",
      "was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and \n",
      "till she had moved about , and talked to herself \n",
      ", and laughed and reflected , she could be fit \n",
      "for nothing rational . Her father 's business was to \n",
      "announce James 's being gone out to put the horses \n",
      "to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls \n",
      "; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse \n",
      "for disappearing . The joy , the gratitude , the \n",
      "exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The \n",
      "sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of \n",
      "Harriet 's welfare , she was really in danger of \n",
      "becoming too happy for security. -- What had she to \n",
      "wish for ? Nothing , but to grow more worthy \n",
      "of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever \n",
      "so superior to her own . Nothing , but that \n",
      "the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility \n",
      "and circumspection in future . Serious she was , very \n",
      "serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; \n",
      "and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes \n",
      "in the very midst of them . She must laugh \n",
      "at such a close ! Such an end of the \n",
      "doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart \n",
      "-- such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure \n",
      "in her returning -- Every thing would be a pleasure \n",
      ". It would be a great pleasure to know Robert \n",
      "Martin . High in the rank of her most serious \n",
      "and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity \n",
      "of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over . \n",
      "The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to \n",
      "her to practise , might soon be over . She \n",
      "could now look forward to giving him that full and \n",
      "perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome \n",
      "as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits \n",
      "she set forward with her father ; not always listening \n",
      ", but always agreeing to what he said ; and \n",
      ", whether in speech or silence , conniving at the \n",
      "comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls \n",
      "every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed \n",
      ". They arrived. -- Mrs . Weston was alone in \n",
      "the drawing-room : -- but hardly had they been told \n",
      "of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks \n",
      "for coming , which he asked for , when a \n",
      "glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures \n",
      "passing near the window . `` It is Frank and \n",
      "Miss Fairfax , '' said Mrs. Weston . `` I \n",
      "was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize \n",
      "in seeing him arrive this morning . He stays till \n",
      "to-morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend \n",
      "the day with us. -- They are coming in , \n",
      "I hope . '' In half a minute they were \n",
      "in the room . Emma was extremely glad to see \n",
      "him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- \n",
      "a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . They \n",
      "met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which \n",
      "at first allowed little to be said ; and having \n",
      "all sat down again , there was for some time \n",
      "such a blank in the circle , that Emma began \n",
      "to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she \n",
      "had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more \n",
      ", and of seeing him with Jane , would yield \n",
      "its proportion of pleasure . When Mr. Weston joined the \n",
      "party , however , and when the baby was fetched \n",
      ", there was no longer a want of subject or \n",
      "animation -- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill \n",
      "to draw near her and say , '' I have \n",
      "to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very \n",
      "kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters \n",
      ". I hope time has not made you less willing \n",
      "to pardon . I hope you do not retract what \n",
      "you then said . '' `` No , indeed , \n",
      "'' cried Emma , most happy to begin , `` \n",
      "not in the least . I am particularly glad to \n",
      "see and shake hands with you -- and to give \n",
      "you joy in person . '' He thanked her with \n",
      "all his heart , and continued some time to speak \n",
      "with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . `` \n",
      "Is not she looking well ? '' said he , \n",
      "turning his eyes towards Jane . `` Better than she \n",
      "ever used to do ? -- You see how my \n",
      "father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her . '' But \n",
      "his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing \n",
      "eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells \n",
      ", he named the name of Dixon. -- Emma blushed \n",
      ", and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . \n",
      "`` I can never think of it , '' she \n",
      "cried , `` without extreme shame . '' `` The \n",
      "shame , '' he answered , `` is all mine \n",
      ", or ought to be . But is it possible \n",
      "that you had no suspicion ? -- I mean of \n",
      "late . Early , I know , you had none \n",
      ". '' `` I never had the smallest , I \n",
      "assure you . '' `` That appears quite wonderful . \n",
      "I was once very near -- and I wish I \n",
      "had -- it would have been better . But though \n",
      "I was always doing wrong things , they were very \n",
      "bad wrong things , and such as did me no \n",
      "service. -- It would have been a much better transgression \n",
      "had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you \n",
      "every thing . '' `` It is not now worth \n",
      "a regret , '' said Emma . `` I have \n",
      "some hope , '' resumed he , `` of my \n",
      "uncle 's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls \n",
      "; he wants to be introduced to her . When \n",
      "the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in \n",
      "London , and continue there , I trust , till \n",
      "we may carry her northward. -- But now , I \n",
      "am at such a distance from her -- is not \n",
      "it hard , Miss Woodhouse ? -- Till this morning \n",
      ", we have not once met since the day of \n",
      "reconciliation . Do not you pity me ? '' Emma \n",
      "spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a \n",
      "sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , '' \n",
      "Ah ! by the bye , '' then sinking his \n",
      "voice , and looking demure for the moment -- '' \n",
      "I hope Mr. Knightley is well ? '' He paused. \n",
      "-- She coloured and laughed. -- '' I know you \n",
      "saw my letter , and think you may remember my \n",
      "wish in your favour . Let me return your congratulations. \n",
      "-- I assure you that I have heard the news \n",
      "with the warmest interest and satisfaction. -- He is a \n",
      "man whom I can not presume to praise . '' \n",
      "Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go \n",
      "on in the same style ; but his mind was \n",
      "the next moment in his own concerns and with his \n",
      "own Jane , and his next words were , '' \n",
      "Did you ever see such a skin ? -- such \n",
      "smoothness ! such delicacy ! -- and yet without being \n",
      "actually fair. -- One can not call her fair . \n",
      "It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark \n",
      "eye-lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion ! So \n",
      "peculiarly the lady in it. -- Just colour enough for \n",
      "beauty . '' `` I have always admired her complexion \n",
      ", '' replied Emma , archly ; `` but do \n",
      "not I remember the time when you found fault with \n",
      "her for being so pale ? -- When we first \n",
      "began to talk of her. -- Have you quite forgotten \n",
      "? '' `` Oh ! no -- what an impudent \n",
      "dog I was ! -- How could I dare -- \n",
      "'' But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , \n",
      "that Emma could not help saying , '' I do \n",
      "suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that \n",
      "time , you had very great amusement in tricking us \n",
      "all. -- I am sure you had. -- I am \n",
      "sure it was a consolation to you . '' `` \n",
      "Oh ! no , no , no -- how can \n",
      "you suspect me of such a thing ? I was \n",
      "the most miserable wretch ! '' `` Not quite so \n",
      "miserable as to be insensible to mirth . I am \n",
      "sure it was a source of high entertainment to you \n",
      ", to feel that you were taking us all in. \n",
      "-- Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because \n",
      ", to tell you the truth , I think it \n",
      "might have been some amusement to myself in the same \n",
      "situation . I think there is a little likeness between \n",
      "us . '' He bowed . `` If not in \n",
      "our dispositions , '' she presently added , with a \n",
      "look of true sensibility , `` there is a likeness \n",
      "in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to \n",
      "connect us with two characters so much superior to our \n",
      "own . '' `` True , true , '' he \n",
      "answered , warmly . `` No , not true on \n",
      "your side . You can have no superior , but \n",
      "most true on mine. -- She is a complete angel \n",
      ". Look at her . Is not she an angel \n",
      "in every gesture ? Observe the turn of her throat \n",
      ". Observe her eyes , as she is looking up \n",
      "at my father. -- You will be glad to hear \n",

      "my uncle means to give her all my aunt 's \n",

      "infant 's appearing not quite well . She believed she \n",
      "had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , \n",
      "and she had been within half a minute of sending \n",
      "for Mr. Perry . Perhaps she ought to be ashamed \n",
      ", but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as \n",
      "herself. -- In ten minutes , however , the child \n",
      "had been perfectly well again . This was her history \n",
      "; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , \n",
      "who commended her very much for thinking of sending for \n",
      "Perry , and only regretted that she had not done \n",
      "it . `` She should always send for Perry , \n",
      "if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , \n",
      "were it only for a moment . She could not \n",
      "be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too \n",
      "often . It was a pity , perhaps , that \n",
      "he had not come last night ; for , though \n",
      "the child seemed well now , very well considering , \n",
      "it would probably have been better if Perry had seen \n",
      "it . '' Frank Churchill caught the name . `` \n",
      "Perry ! '' said he to Emma , and trying \n",
      ", as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax 's \n",
      "eye . `` My friend Mr. Perry ! What are \n",
      "they saying about Mr . Perry ? -- Has he \n",
      "been here this morning ? -- And how does he \n",
      "travel now ? -- Has he set up his carriage \n",
      "? '' Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; \n",
      "and while she joined in the laugh , it was \n",
      "evident from Jane 's countenance that she too was really \n",
      "hearing him , though trying to seem deaf . `` \n",
      "Such an extraordinary dream of mine ! '' he cried \n",
      ". `` I can never think of it without laughing. \n",
      "-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss \n",
      "Woodhouse . I see it in her cheek , her \n",
      "smile , her vain attempt to frown . Look at \n",
      "her . Do not you see that , at this \n",
      "instant , the very passage of her own letter , \n",
      "which sent me the report , is passing under her \n",
      "eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her \n",
      "-- that she can attend to nothing else , though \n",
      "pretending to listen to the others ? '' Jane was \n",
      "forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and \n",
      "the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , \n",
      "and said in a conscious , low , yet steady \n",
      "voice , '' How you can bear such recollections , \n",
      "is astonishing to me ! -- They _will_ sometimes obtrude \n",
      "-- but how you can court them ! '' He \n",
      "had a great deal to say in return , and \n",
      "very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with \n",
      "Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls \n",
      ", and falling naturally into a comparison of the two \n",
      "men , she felt , that pleased as she had \n",
      "been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him \n",
      "as she did with friendship , she had never been \n",
      "more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character \n",
      ". The happiness of this most happy day , received \n",
      "its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth \n",
      "which this comparison produced . CHAPTER XIX If Emma had \n",
      "still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet \n",
      ", a momentary doubt of its being possible for her \n",
      "to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley \n",
      ", and really able to accept another man from unbiased \n",
      "inclination , it was not long that she had to \n",
      "suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A \n",
      "very few days brought the party from London , and \n",
      "she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour \n",
      "alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- \n",
      "unaccountable as it was ! -- that Robert Martin had \n",
      "thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all \n",
      "her views of happiness . Harriet was a little distressed \n",
      "-- did look a little foolish at first : but \n",
      "having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly \n",
      ", and self-deceived , before , her pain and confusion \n",
      "seemed to die away with the words , and leave \n",
      "her without a care for the past , and with \n",
      "the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for \n",
      ", as to her friend 's approbation , Emma had \n",
      "instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting \n",
      "her with the most unqualified congratulations. -- Harriet was most \n",
      "happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley \n",
      "'s , and the dinner the next day ; she \n",
      "could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . \n",
      "But what did such particulars explain ? -- The fact \n",
      "was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet \n",
      "had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing \n",
      "to love her had been irresistible. -- Beyond this , \n",
      "it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event \n",
      ", however , was most joyful ; and every day \n",
      "was giving her fresh reason for thinking so. -- Harriet \n",
      "'s parentage became known . She proved to be the \n",
      "daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her \n",
      "the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and \n",
      "decent enough to have always wished for concealment. -- Such \n",
      "was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been \n",
      "so ready to vouch for ! -- It was likely \n",
      "to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood \n",
      "of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had \n",
      "she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the \n",
      "Churchills -- or even for Mr . Elton ! -- \n",
      "The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth \n",
      ", would have been a stain indeed . No objection \n",
      "was raised on the father 's side ; the young \n",
      "man was treated liberally ; it was all as it \n",
      "should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert \n",
      "Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she \n",
      "fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and \n",
      "worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . \n",
      "She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any \n",
      "good-tempered man ; but with him , and in the \n",
      "home he offered , there would be the hope of \n",
      "more , of security , stability , and improvement . \n",
      "She would be placed in the midst of those who \n",
      "loved her , and who had better sense than herself \n",
      "; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for \n",
      "cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , \n",
      "nor left for it to find her out . She \n",
      "would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her \n",
      "to be the luckiest creature in the world , to \n",
      "have created so steady and persevering an affection in such \n",
      "a man ; -- or , if not quite the \n",
      "luckiest , to yield only to herself . Harriet , \n",
      "necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , \n",
      "was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not \n",
      "to be regretted. -- The intimacy between her and Emma \n",
      "must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer \n",
      "sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought \n",
      "to be , and must be , seemed already beginning \n",
      ", and in the most gradual , natural manner . \n",
      "Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to \n",
      "church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin \n",
      "with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , \n",
      "even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them \n",
      ", could impair. -- Perhaps , indeed , at that \n",
      "time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton , but as the \n",
      "clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on \n",
      "herself. -- Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest \n",
      "couple engaged of the three , were the first to \n",
      "be married . Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , \n",
      "and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home \n",
      "with the Campbells. -- The Mr. Churchills were also in \n",
      "town ; and they were only waiting for November . \n",
      "The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as \n",
      "far as they dared , by Emma and Mr . \n",
      "Knightley. -- They had determined that their marriage ought to \n",
      "be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield \n",
      ", to allow them the fortnight 's absence in a \n",
      "tour to the seaside , which was the plan. -- \n",
      "John and Isabella , and every other friend , were \n",
      "agreed in approving it . But Mr. Woodhouse -- how \n",
      "was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent ? -- \n",
      "he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage \n",
      "but as a distant event . When first sounded on \n",
      "the subject , he was so miserable , that they \n",
      "were almost hopeless. -- A second allusion , indeed , \n",
      "gave less pain. -- He began to think it was \n",
      "to be , and that he could not prevent it \n",
      "-- a very promising step of the mind on its \n",
      "way to resignation . Still , however , he was \n",
      "not happy . Nay , he appeared so much otherwise \n",
      ", that his daughter 's courage failed . She could \n",
      "not bear to see him suffering , to know him \n",
      "fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced \n",
      "in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys , that \n",
      "when once the event were over , his distress would \n",
      "be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could \n",
      "not proceed . In this state of suspense they were \n",
      "befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse \n",
      "'s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous \n",
      "system , but by the operation of the same system \n",
      "in another way. -- Mrs. Weston 's poultry-house was robbed \n",
      "one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the \n",
      "ingenuity of man . Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also \n",
      "suffered. -- Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr. Woodhouse 's fears. \n",
      "-- He was very uneasy ; and but for the \n",
      "sense of his son-in-law 's protection , would have been \n",
      "under wretched alarm every night of his life . The \n",
      "strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the \n",
      "Mr. Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either \n",
      "of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe. \n",
      "-- But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again \n",
      "by the end of the first week in November . \n",
      "The result of this distress was , that , with \n",
      "a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter \n",
      "had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , \n",
      "she was able to fix her wedding-day -- and Mr. \n",
      "Elton was called on , within a month from the \n",
      "marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join \n",
      "the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse . The \n",
      "wedding was very much like other weddings , where the \n",
      "parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and \n",
      "Mrs. Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband \n",
      ", thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior \n",
      "to her own. -- '' Very little white satin , \n",
      "very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business ! \n",
      "-- Selina would stare when she heard of it . \n",
      "'' -- But , in spite of these deficiencies , \n",
      "the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the \n",
      "predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed \n",
      "the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness \n",
      "of the union . FINIS \n"
